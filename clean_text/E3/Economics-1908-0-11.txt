tions are the worst foe of progress. Law can be made mobile
only by the proper appreciation of economic change; economics
can be saved from a series of revolutions only by the spirit of law.
When these two sciences are properly blended evolution will be
constant and progress orderly.
Comrades, are you satisfied? Do you point with pride to what
you have done or do you look ahead for new fields to enter? We
can all, it is true, report an increase of students, more enthusiasm,
better results. But are these worthy objects, the goal of economics?
To me only two ends seem prominent enough to deserve
approbation: the redemption of the college and the control of
public opinion. The one end we can attain through the superiority
of our class instruction; the other we can acquire indirectly
by giving clearer ideals and better programs to those who direct
public affairs. We now have the place in education that Greek
formerly had and upon us therefore depend the perpetuation of
the college and the ennobling of its aims. We must socialize it by
making sympathy, co6peration and generosity its dominant
ideals. What we do for the college our allies can do for the
nation. First the economist, then the journalist and finally the
legislator; this is the order of progress and the key to success.
The world is ours if we enter it by the right door.

c'hanges. Our courts declare the law, it is true, but in
declaring the law, they must keep ini mind the fact that
the intention of prime importance in the minds of our
forefathers was the welfare of the people throughout the
coming generations; and they will not rigidly insist upon
an unchanging applicatiotn of old words to new conditions.
The Courts will of course be slow and careful
in their adaptations of laws to new conditions, but eventually
the conditions will force the reasonable interpretation.
Some people are of the opinion that our Courts

worth careful consideration. In the discu-ssion oI stuch
questions as these just asked, therefore, the point chiefly
to be kept in minid is this: Are the local and state governments
so organized that they can meet the new economic
conditions? We need not now inlquire what specific
conditions the foulinders of our government had in mind
when they wrote the Constittution, with the added thotught,
perhaps, that we must, so far as possible, attempt to hold
oulrselves back to the conditions of a century ago. With
present conditions in mind, federal control of interstate

control, the character and industrial habits and
temper of the people. If the citizens of a country are
ignorant, unenterprising, poor, weak, they will have little
initiative and the government must take into its own
hands the organization, financing and management of

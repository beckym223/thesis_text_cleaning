IT SHOULD FIX LIMITS OF COMPETITION.
It may sometimes be desirable, in order that the benefits
of private enterprise may be secured without giving to
private corporations the unreasonable profits which under
certain monopolistic circumstances they might be able to
secure, that the government compete directly with private
enterprise in order to hold prices within reasonable bounds.
It might become best for the post-office, for example, to
extend its parcel post in competition with the express
companies. Ordinarily, however, the government can
best direct the private management of public enterprises
through inspection and supervision rather than by direct
competition. We must recognize the fact that competition
affords on the whole the best stimulus to effort, to
originality of thought, and to the development of personality
in enterprise. The government may thus, as
already intimated, speaking generally, secure the public
welfare best by encouraging private enterprise, simply
fixing the limits of competition within standards of
honesty and efficiency of service. This principle of
competition, too, it should be recognized, is found not
merely in business where the reward is money profit, but
likewise in all other fields of endeavor, where the reward
may be fame or merely a spirit of self-satisfaction over
good work well done. There is competition in football,
even in philanthropy, as well as in money making. The
government should simply see to it that the competition
in all directions is kept within fair and just limits.

OF CONTROL.
IO. Whether the government will or no, it cannot
throw off the responsibilitY of supervision and control
over such industrial enterprises as we have considered,

special favors to the strong; it must search out and prevent
dishonest practices of those whose wealth comes not
from service but from plunder and fraud, whether legal
or illegal.

Second, it is the duty of all of us to recognize that in
business as well as in politics the laborer is worthy of his
hire. Each of us should feel that our work is primarily
for the service of society; but we should also feel that
when others are rendering a service to us or to society,
they should receive the just reward of that service. Thru
their weakness and thru our selfishness, thru unenlightened
self-interest, (not enlightened self-interest, for
enlightened self-interest takes into view a nobler
society), we have often tempted people into dishonest
practices by holding them down. to unjustly low rewards,
by trying always to buy in the cheapest, not in
the fairest, market. The Consumers' League is
doing a little to combat this tendency, but the bargain
counter is still ahead, in high places as in low.
The demand, public or private, that a man whose services
are actually worth $50,ooo a year shall receive only

skilled wage-earner shall receive only a pittance to keep
him from starvation. The main difference is that the
strong man is more likely to take indirectly and wrongly

competitive system of industry, we as individuals should
be glad to give the largest profit to him who either renders
to society the best service of all the competitors, or
by masterly and just organization of his business can
render equal service with less expenditure of industrial
energy. We should discriminate between fortunes gained
by real service and those gained unjustly by gambling
speculation or oppressive monopoly. We should be willing

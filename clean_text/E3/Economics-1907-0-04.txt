whereas in the case of the Trust, properly enough, there
is world-wide condemnation. Are the cases different in
nature or only in degree? In the one, a village is the
victim of monopoly; in the other, a nation. In the one
case, the monopolist is a petty tyrant to be despised; in
the other, a monster to be feared. Such different effects
are produced on our feelings merely by an increase in
the scale of operations.
Results no less striking are produced by lack of personal
association. Dr. George P. Watkins, in a paper
as yet unpublished, has properly laid great emphasis upon
the well-known fact that the wealth of the rich is held
to-day so largely in the form of stocks and bonds that the
owner has little personal touch either with the property
which his securities represent or with its management.
He knows that he has so many thousands or hundreds
of thousands of dollars invested in this railway
or that corporation, but so long as he draws his
dividends promptly, he is often content not to know
more. Until the middle of the last century the situation
was vastly different. The wealthy man managed
his wealth himself; he saw with his own eyes
the work, the home-life, the personal conditions of his
workmen. As a merchant or as a manufacturer, he dealt
personally with his customers and price-fixing might well
be a matter of personal discussion. The transaction often
assumed the nature of gift or favor, on the one side; on
the other, that of personal appeal. When dealings are
on a small scale, discriminations between persons are
often not only not injurious to society, they are highly
commendable. When, however, the articles purchased
or the services bought are not for immediate consumption
but for further production; when the effect of the
discrimination, instead of ending with the personal benefit

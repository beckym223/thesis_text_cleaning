ture, how much would receive the mark of approval which
would justify its retention? Is it too much to say that a
considerable part would be passed over? Supply of ma-
terial is now furnished under monopoly conditions, and
};ot under the stress of competition,-a force which
quickly discards useless effort. Demand ought to control
the supply, but, as it is, supply mystifies and befogs the
demand. Monopolistic production, generously subsidized,
of all fornms of production requires expert direction.
No one individually is to blame for this condition of af-
fairs. The fault is in the systemn. The economist has
been living far apart from the official observatories. Busy
with the analysis of motives, psychological effects, grati-
fications, welfare subtly conceived as a product of dy-
namic forces rather than of static conditions, engrossed
with detecting movements, their direction and signi-

composition and characteristics of the things compared,
he neglects his humble co-workers whose business it is to
record economic phenomena in so far as they admit of
record. The observer has consequently been left to his
own devices; sometimes he is directed by the mandate of
a legislature which rarely seeks expert advice; sometimes
he has been prompted by a passing interest derived from a
newspaper discussion; sometimes by a personal whim.
More frequently he has proceeded along the line of least
resistance, recording data which could be easily secured,
irrespective of any other quality. As a nation we are
altogether too credulous, and have yet to learn that col-
unms of figures are not statistics.
In making these statements I would not forget the val-

increasing tendency on the part of governments, whether
national, state, or local, to call into service trained stu-

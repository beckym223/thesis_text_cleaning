nature of government and in that of business. A brief
review of so broad ancd complicated a question, even
though it contains little that is new, may still be useful in
bringing together some old and well-worn but perhaps

them as settled, even though I am aware that the statement
is debatable. It is often perhaps as great a service
to state a question for discussion as to argue it.
THE AUTHORITY AND CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT
NECESSARY.
2. In all civilized states, whether government be personal
or popular, a fundamental condition of political stability
and of social and economic prosperity is that under
the constitution and customs of the country, so far as the
individual members of society need control, they must be
controlled by government and the government must direct
these activities of the citizens as it thinks best. In a democracy,
and it is chiefly of a democracy that I shall
speak, if the people think that the views or the acts of

but in any event there cannot be business success without
stable government. The doings of the people in cases
where the government acts, must be through the hands of
officials and these acts must be put into effect in the manner

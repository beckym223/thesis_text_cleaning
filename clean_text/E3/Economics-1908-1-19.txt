their reserves. They had too often resorted to practices
doubtful for a fiduciary business; they had counted deposits
in other banks as part of their owni resources, a
practice which, though legal, is of doubtful wisdom, and
when the storm came, each looking to his own need (with
the exception of some of the larger establishments whose
own close relations with the market compelled action),
got what cash he could and retained it in his vaults, thus
increasing the tension of the stringency. Unless the
bankers can devise better plans than they now practice
for checking the reckless among their fellows and hearteninag
the over-cautious, the Government must play a
more active part in control. I do not mlean that the
Treasutry is to be more active in an emergency. The
governnient must do more to prevent the emergency's
arising. And this principle applies, not only to banks, but
with greater emphasis to all great companies, railroads
and trusts, AVhose stocks are at the mercy of the directors,
and the prices of whose products within rather broad
limits are only slightly regulated by competition. What
does a stockholder in a great corporation like the American
Tobacco Co., or the American Sugar Refining Co., or
the Standard Oil Co., or any of the 50 largest Trust companies,
kncew of the real value of his holdings and of what
may be done within three months to increase or lower the
value? And what does the public know of the measures
that may be taken to increase or lower the prices which
the grocers must pay the manufacturing, companies for
their goods? Business men in these important positions
will in time learn their duty toward the public, but probably
the Government must lead the way. The change
from small industrial conditions to large has come so
swiftly that the business men in most cases are not morally
to blame for their lack of adjustment to new conditions,

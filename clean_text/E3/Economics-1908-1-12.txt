ciety, defending the direct management of certain lines of
business by the state, Professor Jevons laid down in his
suggestive way the following principles concerning the
industries, and the only industries, he thought, which
could wisely be managed by the state:
I. Where numberless widespread operations can only
be efficiently connected, united and co-ordinated, in a
single and extensive government system.
2. Where the operations possess an invariable routinelike
character.
3. Where they are performed under the public eye or
for the service of individuals, who will immediately detect
and expose any failure or laxity.
4. Where there is but little capital expenditure, so that
each year's revenue and expense account shall represent,
with sufficient accuracy, the real commercial conditions of
the department.
The post-office is perhaps the best example of such an
industry. Professor Jevons thought these principles applied
fairly well to the telegraph and parcels post, but
not to railways. As applied to England thirty years ago
his opinion was probably sound. The experience of the
last few years would probably permit in several countries
some extension of these principles; but they are still
extremely suggestive and useful in testing industries
which the government contemplates managing.
GREAT EXECUTIVE TALENT BEST PAID BY PRIVATE
COMPANIES.
6. The success of all great industrial enterprises depends
largely upon the executive head-he must be interested
and be as intelligent and as skilful as possible.
Such men must ordinarily be chosen only for the sake
of the business itself. The experience of centuries has
shown that, take it by and large, the motive of selfinterest
is the one that can best be counted upon to

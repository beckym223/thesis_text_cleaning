economists since this association was founded. So popular has
economic thinking become, so prominent is its position in all
colleges and universities, so numerous are the books, articles and
journals devoted to its discussion, that it seems a natural state of
affairs that must always have existed. And yet all this is the
work of a group of enthusiasts, meeting at Saratoga 23 years ago
without a single book to their credit, without journal to voice
their views and without university position to give them support.
Today economics is in everyone's thought and on everyone's
lips. We do not lack students; we do not lack organs or audience;
nor do we lack zeal for the further prosecution of the work already
begun. So much we can fairly claim and all honor to those who
have taken part in the work. If this were our only goal we
might be proudly satisfied with our record and pass on the Associa-
tion to our successors with a consciousness of a life's work well
done.
There is, however, no great American problem that has been
solved. With every vital question we stand on a half-way ground,
halting between the old and the new, and if these half truths are
all we have to offer we may harm the public more than we aid
them. Confusion and defeat stare us in the face politically,
morally and economically, if the disappearance of old customs,
traditions and modes of thought is not followed by the rise of new
concepts, ideals and institutions. We cannot afford to be mere
iconoclasts. We must lay the foundation of a new civilization
and show how economic forces will remedy evils that may soon
be unbearable. We have thus a problem-a difficult problem to
master. Are we mastering it or merely drifting with the tide?

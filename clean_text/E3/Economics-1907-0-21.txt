our search for bargains, our eagerness to get on.
It is a cheering fact that we are now seeing the evils in
politics and in business. Our eyes were dim to new
abuses. The misdeeds had to be on a grand scale to attract
our attention. But now we see them; and seeing
them clearly, we shall soon see farther. Ultimately we
poorer, common people in private life will see our own
faults. Then progress will be faster. There is still
much more to do for each of us, in seeing more clearly
the application of the simple, old-fashioned principles of
private honesty to the great transactions of corporate
business and to the still greater problems of statesmanship.


Some years ago, one of my ablest and best-liked colleagues
took me to task because in writing about the
Trusts I had, while trying to point out the evils, noted
some good in them. "But did I not show the bad, and
was not the good true?", I asked. "Yes," he replied in
substance, "I don't deny that; but we want to get the people
to act in correction of abuses; and the people will not
act unless their feelings are aroused. We lull them into
inaction by balancing good and evil; let us show the evils,
the Trusts themselves will show the good." Highly as
I regard my friend, and noble as I know his motives to
be, that seems to me pernicious doctrine. It has in it
the seeds of revolution, not of progress. In social evolution,
the race is rarely to the swift, but always to the
safe and sure, and nothing less than transparent honesty
is safe. Underlying all our social structure is our standard
of business honor with the right application of that
standard to our complex social conditions. This can be
secured only by showing to our people not merely truth
about business, but the whole truth. We must fix our
standard; we must gradually approach it.

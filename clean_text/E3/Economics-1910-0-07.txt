facts will then occupy a separate field of its own; its cul-
tivation will be carried on by independent and intelligent
methods for certain definite, clearly prescribed ends.
Pending this happy deliverance, however, what can be
done for the student, and what can be done to save ob-
servation, induction, and the significance of facts so that
their imiiportance will not be wholly lost?
Taking political economy as it is written, it is that

Even many of the authors who retain the classical defini-

There are two fields for observation: first, the wants

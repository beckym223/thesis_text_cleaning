facts will then occupy a separate field of its own; its cultivation
will be carried on by independent and intelligent
methods for certain definite, clearly prescribed ends.
Pending this happy deliverance, however, what can be
done for the student, and what can be done to save observation,

their imiiportance will not be wholly lost?

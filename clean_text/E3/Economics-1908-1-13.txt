secure the best executive talent. Under our present stage
of civilization private corporations will give higher pay
and better facilities for individual initiative and skill in
work than is possible for the State in the present condition
of public opinion. It is generally conceded here as well
as in England that lawyers and captains of industry

Some striking examples have been afforded in recelnt

enterprise of the present century, the Panama Canal, in
order to enter the service of private corporations.
BUT MEN SERVE ALSO FROM SENSE OF DUTY.
And yet, on the other hand, the attractiveness of public

service. Every person of wide acquaintance can nmention
instances from among his own list of friends. It is perhaps
most usual to find instances of devotion to public

Point stands ready to sacrifice self if necessary for the
sake of duty. I am glad to say that I have found not a
little of this same spirit of devotion to duty in the civil
service. I think it is rapidly extending and that this will
soon materially affect our government work. On the
other hand, men trained to rigid unquestioning obedience,

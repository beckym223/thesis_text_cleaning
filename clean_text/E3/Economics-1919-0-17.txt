It is given to us as to no previous generation of economists to
share in fixing the foundations for a new economic organization
and one which shall harmonize with the principles of democracy.
If we are to succeed it will be because we perform our task with
wisdom, unselfishness, and impartiality. As economists in public
service in a democratic world we are pledged not to serve simply
our local community, our own country, or our own time, but to
serve rather all humanity throughout the world and throughout
future generations.

to adopt entirely new principles of management, if its system of
exploitation is to be as economical as was the formler.
However, no matter how liberal we may be in permitting to
count as true economy the lavish use of natural resources in the
(levelopment of a civilization, I think there is general agreement
after all among students of the subject that the people of the
United States have at many points been wasteful in the true sense
of that term, namely, in producing their sum total of national
wealth at a cost beyond what would lhave beeni occasionedl if a
better systein of exploitation had been adopted.
But with this concession, I desire to emphasize again what
seems to me to be the fact in the case, that the discovery,
development, and training of the talents and abilities of our people
is of far more significance to the continued and increasing production
of national wealth than is the so-called conservation
policy, important as that is. We may fairly enough, if we are
wise in our day and generation, through the increasing intelligence
of our people, develop the conditions of an increase of national
wealth far more rapidly than we are losing them through the
exploitation of our natural resources.

I have myself never been able to become excited over the
demonstrations which are afforded from time to time that the
human race is destined ultimately to poverty and despair because
of the exhaustion of our coal fields.

We certainly should not waste our coals in the sense of using
them up with nothing to show for such use. But, on the other
hand, the proposition to preserve the coal which we may profitably
use now in the development of industry or increasing the comfort
of humanity because we are afraid that our posterity may suffer
from cold or hunger, would seem to me to be absurd. I believe
that if the race were to give its attention steadily to the scientific
and practical investigation of means of laying under direct contribution
the energy of the sun, of the falling water, the flowving
stream, the sweeping tides, the rushing winds,-I say if the race
would spend a tithe of the money upon the studv of that problem
which it has given to the study of the means of destroying its
members, we might safely proceed to use up our coal fields to the
last ton, relying upon our abilitv in the long run to discover
adequate-nay more than adequate-substitutes for the energy
and light and heat pent up in this wonderful storehouse of nature.
The same thing is true in regard to the exploitation of the

opinion, representing, at any time, a clear maj ority of the
community.7
It would seem to require no demonstration that a state political-
ly, or an economic organization within a state, cannot be consid-
ered in stable equilibrium, or likely to endure unchanged, when
under a wide suffrage and extended political rights the majority of
the people want that system changed.
But this is not a disturbing thought. It means evolution, not
revolution; not abolition of private property, but the bring-
ing of the rights of private property into harmony with the
desires and needs of the age. No sudden or violent change or
destruction is needed, but a gradual, orderly, and peaceful modi-
fication and adaptation of institutions, and consequently of eco-
nomics, to a modern, changed environment and to public welfare.

with the actual feelings and demands of the community, whether right or
wrong."-O. W. Holmes, Jr., The Common Law, p. 41.

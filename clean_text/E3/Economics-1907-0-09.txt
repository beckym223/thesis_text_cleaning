to the relation of one state to another? None of the
ties which bind man to man can join state to state.
The command 'Love thy neighbor as thyself,' cannot be
applied here. The state is so far from turning the left
cheek to him who strikes the right, that on the contrary,
it does and must endeavor to anticipate even a threatened
blow with an energetic counter-stroke... In short, the
entire chapter of the duties of love, which is the chief
doctrine of the moral law, has no application to the conduct
of the state. A nation depends, not upon the love
of others, but upon the love of self, upon the fostering
and development of its own power and prosperity; and
if we characterize this by the term 'egoism,' -a term indeed
that is scarcely applicable-then egoism certainly is
the foundation of all politics."

In short, this political standard of morality, so often
advocated by statesmen, says practically: Rulers as trustees
for their fellow-citizens cannot follow in all regards
the standards of private morality. It is their duty as
trustees, at all hazards, first to preserve the existence of
their state, and, secondly, to secure its prosperity, as they
see its prosperity. Naturally, also, their willingness to
guard this prosperity is increased by the fact that they as
rulers will gain thru the strengthening of their state.
From this principle thus stated, baldly, and with unpleasant
frankness, is derived the principle in accordance
with which a ruler claims the right and feels the duty to
summon his fellow-citizens to sacrifice their lives for the
advancement of the state; from which he feels called
upon, in case of their refusal, to compel them against
their will to go to war and die for the existence, and often
for merely the greater prosperity, of the state. And as
he defends himself for these public acts (which otherwise
would be murder) on the ground of supporting the

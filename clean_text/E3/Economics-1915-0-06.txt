 the Supreme Court reverses itself, or until the constitution is 
 amended on this point, the power to determine public policy, 
 and consequently the content and extent of contract and private 
 property, in the hands of the court instead of the legislature, or 
 more popular branch of the government. It is interesting to specu- 
 late as to what might have happened in a few decades if the doc- 
 trine of contract as laid down in the Dartmouth College case could 
 have been maintained, and the courts had not dragged in the 
 police power as a serious modification and mollification of that 
 doctrine. 
 But even such a change did not keep the doctrine up to the 
 changing popular ideas of the right of contract and of private 
 property. The country found relief once more in a genuine polit- 
 ical revolution under Jackson, which issued in the reconstruction 
 of the court under Chief Justice Taney. When the first test case 
 came before the reorganized court (Charles River Bridge case, 
 1837), it was seen at once by the court that the application of 
 the Dartmouth College case would neither satisfy public opinion 
 nor permit the proper development of New England, save on the 
 sole condition that the people of Massachusetts would be willing to 
 tax themselves to compensate the owners of the Charles River 
 bridge for a property which had actually been destroyed when the 
 legislature chartered the defendant company to build a parallel 
 bridge, which, under the terms of the charter, had already become 
 free before this decision was rendered. 
 But the people of Massachusetts believed that the first bridge 
 company had received an adequate compensation for the use of its 
 property and for all the effort and risk ever incurred, and was, 
 therefore, not justly entitled to compensation. In the popular 
 judgment the company had been unduly greedy, and for private 
 gain had checked and prevented the necessary and desirable de- 
 velopment of the community. Under these circumstances there 
 was nothing for the court to do but to sustain the popular opinion 
 of Massachusetts, and thereby confiscate the property of the 
 Charles River Bridge Company, by an interpretation that can 
 scarcely be squared logically with the Dartmouth College case, 
 or with the earlier decisions in regard to ferries and toll bridges. 
 Much more striking illustrations appear in our history of the 
 fact that you cannot by any written constitution, or fiction of hold- 
 ing popular opinion in check, in fact, maintain a form or content 
 of private property indefinitely in opposition to a well formed and

number in accordance with the method of major fractions, and to
report the result to Congress or to announce it by executive proclaination.
The experiment which was tried in 1850 and 1860 and
which then failed, partly because of inherent defects of method
which have since been overcome, and partly because of problems,
no longer important, which arose out of the rapid admission of new
states and the absence of many members during the Civil War, can
now be repeated with more chance of success. As the House is
larger by four fifths than it was in 1856 and rapidly growing,
the arguments against further increase are stronger.
With a firm grasp of the elements of the problem and a century
of experience revealing what Congress regards as the essentials of
a sound method, the chance of meeting the conditions are better.
Ere long the pressure of opinion within or without the halls of
Congress is likely to result in a renewal of the effort to fix the size
of the House unalterably. If that effort is made, the removal of
the teclnical difficulties to which your attention has been called
this evening will have smoothed the path toward success and have
made it more likelv that when the change is again introduced it
will be permanent.

a school in which some of the brighest children of their generation
shall be educated, children who on growing to maturity move
away into some other district, some other country, some other
state, and bring into the particular locality in which they may
finally settle all the advantages which this educational process
has brought to thenm. How many of our western cities have grown
strong because of able and educated men who have come into them
fromn the districts of New York or New England! How large a
part of the funds of the New England country schools for the last
fifty years have gone for the education of men whose contribution
to the locality in which they lived and to the nation came not
through New England at all, but through Illinois, and Wisconsin,
an(l Minnesota! In fact no one can tell what particular portion
of the country will profit most by the fact that the people in
some remote school district of Pennsylvania have taxed themselves
to the limit for the purpose of training in the best possible way
the children of that district. One may safely say that in all
probability the chief advantage would rather accrue to some other
district than to that which made the sacrifices. Now as long as
that is true, here is a logical, or ethical, reason, if you please, why
a part of the expense of the local school and the local school
system shall be borne by the nation.
This would be still truer of this comprehensive system of
national education which I have been discussing; for in proportion
as the expense increases, in proportion as the service of the school
becomes larger, in proportion as it serves a greater range of
human ability, does this principle which I have referred to hold
good, that the results of this training accrue, in all probability,
to the advantage of some other locality, some other state, some
other section of the country.
There is another reason already noted in the case of the South
why the nation must assist in the development and support of
the kind of system which I have been describing, and that is the
simple one that many of the localities, many of the states, cannot
of themselves raise the necessary funds to establish, develop, and
maintain such a system of education. There are many sections
of even the wealthiest portions of the country, the states north
of Mason and Dixon's line and east of the Rocky Mountains and
beyond the Cascade range, many localities which without the aid
of the state, in large measure, could not possibly undertake to
raise the funds by anv reasonable system of revenue open to them,

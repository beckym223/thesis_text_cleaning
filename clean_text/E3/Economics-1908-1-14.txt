whose entire life is placed at the disposal of their superiors
f rom day to day, are, I think, likely to lack somewhat
in the personal initiative demanded of those whose
way from obscurity to success must be fougLht through
stern competition. In private management of business
the weak are rutlhlessly cut out, the strong move forward.
In public life men are much more likely to receive positions
through political pressure or through a type of
examination that does not give the best test of efficiency,
or through routine work and length of service. For
these reasons we ordinarily expect to find, and experience
shows that the expectation is well-founded, that enterprises
will generally be carried through mnore promptly
and with less expense in the hands of private managers
than under public management.
ATTITUDE TOWARDS SOCIALISM.
7. These circumstances indicate clearly the wise attitude
toward socialism, if by socialism we mean the policy
of taking into the hands of the state for ownership and
management the capitalistic industries. Possibly such a
policy may be best in some ages and climes; such a policy,
however, could be successful in modern industry only
by a change of human attributes or of social conditions
so great as to be practically revolutionary. An avaricious
man is not likely to become public-spirited in office; he
will rather prostitute his office to personal gain.
We need not, however, be frightened by a name. It
may well be, that, under certain circumstances, a city may
find it wise to own and manage its water works and its
street railways; under other circumstances for special
reasons, usually political, a state must administer its
railway system; again, a great manufacturing enterprise
or a gigantic work of public betterment may wisely be
carried through by the state. Experience, however, in

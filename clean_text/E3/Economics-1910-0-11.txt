only the corners of many of them are seen; and if ever
labeled at all, too frequently the labels have been nlisplaced.


Are we not rash in assuming that the concept, competition,
is generally understood? And can it be understood
until we ask who compete, where do the units compete,
or to what degree do they or can they compete? The
term nmonopoly is used as if there were no doubt as to its
implication, and yet few recognize a monopoly when they
meet it face to face in the broad sunlight, and many apply
the term when it has no true significance.
Our observation is governed by our imagination. As
the psychologist observes, one child sees in a stick a
horse; another, a doll; and, we may add, under the influence
of this fancy, creates around this stick anl unreal
world. One observer of a group of economic phenomena
will see an industrial warfare in which each of the units
is endeavoring to exploit his fellows; another in viewing
the same picture beholds a scene of tranquillity in which
each is following his own intent, and realizing his own
individual desires. Each creates an unreality. We would
not destroy the imagination of a child, but fanciful imagination
is not the tool of science. In time the stick becomes
to the child nothing but a stick and is evaluated
as such; but for the adult there is no training which will
dissolve the economic fantasy.

Moreover, exact observation is necessary to serve as
the basis of deduction. If the facts are vitiated, how can
abstract reasoning test its results; how can it dare to attempt
new flights? If Newton had not been able to distinguish
between an apple and a puff-ball, it is probable
that his famous hypothesis would have gone unprovoked.
Imperfect vision is responsible for much of the economic
reasoning associated with schools of propaganda at the

Germany is mastering the world. Germany is forcing us to become
a great military and naval power. What if she forces us to
becomie an efficient industrial power?
It depends on the purpose. Modern industry is much alike in
all countries and its conditions of efficiency are much the same.
But the purposes for which it is used may differ. If our purpose
is to make use of our people in order to gain more power for the
state over other nations, then, as contributing to that purpose
we shall raise capital by taxation and invest it in navies and armaments
and shall back up speculative investments abroad. If our
purpose is to open up our own resources for future billions of
surplus capital and for future millions of population, then we
shall raise capital, also largely by taxation, but shall invest it
in those basic industries which no longer can be left to speculation.
Only government can choose which of these purposes shall be
first. The will of the state decides. And already have American
democracy and the Supreme Court begun to point out both the
theory and the practice by which the American government may
give a preference to domestic investment over foreign investment.

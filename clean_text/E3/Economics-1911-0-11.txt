When our secondary school was developed, though at first
very narrow in its scope, it accomplished even more striking results,
because it helped develop the directing talent in the community.
A system of national education having in view the objects
which I have suggested must include, speaking generally, for the
people who remain in school, two elements, which for purposes of
discrimination we may generallv describe as the liberal and tech-
nical elements. Under the head of the liberal element I should
include those fundamental features such as reading, writing, and
ciphering, which are the keys, so to speak, to the experience of the
race. But I should not by any means limit the scope of this in-
struction to these three R's, for it is certain that one of the funda-
mental objects of a national system of education can never be
realized unless the range of instruction in the elementary school
far exceeds these so-called fundamentals. Certainly one of the
purposes of any system of education must be to discover the
talents of the child, must be to find out in what way, that is, by the
special development of what faculties, he may do his greatest ser-
vice to his day and generation. Some men make their most im-
portant contribution as ditch diggers, as farm hands, as mechanics
in the mills; others as directors in these occupations; still others
as artists, teachers, lawyers, or physicians. A national system of
education ought to find out the peculiar abilities of the child and
put him in a way to develop them. This means, of course, that
among the so-called fads, drawing and singing and a wide range
of art work, should be represented in the elementary school as
well as the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, geography
and history and science.
But no child can afford to spend even the first twelve years
of his life without coming in contact with some kind of training of
the body and training of the mind which touches in some direct
way the possibilities of his future occupations; and so manual
training and domestic science, at least in their rudiments, must
form a part of this fundamental, this common instruction which
all children should have. That is to say, when our compulsory
school laws are universal and really enforced, the school will have
before it the problem of occupying in the best way from seven to
eight years of the pupil's life; and in this time every child, not
merely the white children, but the colored children as well; not
merely the citizens of Massachusettts and New York, but those of
Alabama and Louisiana; not merely the children of Ohio and

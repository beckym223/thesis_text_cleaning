When later this territory was divided into states, the federal
government gave, from lands which belonged to it, large endowments
for the purpose of assisting the localities in the further
development of the schools and for the purpose of stimulating local
and state activity in the direction of developing and supporting
schools. The federal government continued later this same policy
of large endowment of education within the states by these grants
of federal land; and finally in the later legislation it did not content
itself with giving these lands to the states for the purpose of
education, but it made it a condition of admission of these states
to the Union that they should administer these funds for this
purpose and for no other.
I think it is beyond doubt that the policy of the federal
government, in thus granting to these newer states these federal
lands, has brought about the wonderful developments in popular
education which we have thus far achieved in this great Mississippi
Valley and in the states beyond the mountains. It was not merely,
as I have suggested before, because these lands were given to start
these schools, for in many cases the states in the first instance,
not being inclined to education, dissipated these funds, used them
for other purposes, and covered themselves with disgrace for the
flagrant way in which they disregarded the implicit pledges involved
in the acceptance of these lands for educational purposes.
But still more than the positive support which these lands gave
to common school education was the stimulus, was the example,
held continually before the minds of the community, set by the
federal government, of giving a portion and a considerable portion
of the public wealth to these purposes. It was a constant reproach
to the people of any state who dissipated these funds or
used them for other purposes, that the federal government had
set apart these lands out of the territory of the nation for public
education. The example was a constant challenge to the people
of every state that they should also give attention to these same
questions, and that as their wealth and strength increased they
should develop ever more strongly and completely this system of
popular education.
On the whole they have done so. The dav of squandering these
great endowments of education has passed away, though in every
state where this fund is great the public must safeguard its interest
with great watchfulness.
But the federal government was not content with giving these

sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, tends
to blind his eyes to the social results of many of his acts.
When, then, the question comes to a director, or to the
president of a corporation, whether he shall observe the
law, (which may even, at times, seem to him unjust), at the
expense of sacrificing the dividends of thousands of stockholders
for whom he is a trustee, and perhaps incidentally
of sacrificing his own position if he fails to earn these
dividends, even tho he knows that the violation of the
law may injure some people to him personally unknown,
it is natural that he should feel the pressure of his
trusteeship for his stockholders more strongly than the
pressure of his trusteeship for the public. He does
wrong. I am not excusing him. I am trying to understand
him; to see how a man who is upright and honorable
in most matters does wrong in business.

I have had important shippers say to me that they not
merely disliked to receive rebates contrary to law, but
that they would use their every effort to secure a law which
would prevent the granting and the acceptance of rebates.
But when, from current prices, they saw that one of their
rivals was receiving a certain rebate, and that unless they
secured a like concession, they would be forced out of
business, was it to be expected that they would hesitate?
Without the rebate, the interests of their stockholders
and their own personal interests would be sacrificed.
With it, tho contrary to law, they and their rivals would
be placed on an equal footing. Their interests enable
them to see their stockholders near at hand; the public
seems dim in the distance. Let us try to be fair. It may
be that we are partly to blame. If our laws are unjust,
we must share the guilt.

The manager of the great corporation may often give
other reasons for his acts that sound very interesting.

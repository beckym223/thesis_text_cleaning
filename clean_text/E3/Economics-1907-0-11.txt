ground that their opponents are doing the same, and
that the welfare of the state depends upon the success
of their party; so the manager of a corporation,
knowing well that his rivals are violating the law
by accepting rebates, or evading the contract labor law,
or the laws regarding the labor of women and children,
and that if he does not do the same, he must go out of
business, sacrificing thereby the interests of his stockholders,

misguided perhaps, but none the less real, to do likewise.
Men of irreproachable private life, good husbands and
fathers, Christian gentlemen in their private acts, will at
times send spies to discover the secrets of their rivals in
business, will bribe the employees of their competitors to
disclose the secrets of their employers, will take every
means possible to secure an advantage which in a private
game they would consider unsportsmanlike and mean;
and they will justify themselves to their own consciences
for these acts. When the president of an insurance
company contributed to the campaign fund of a political
party, the success of whose principles he felt would insure
the welfare of his stockholders, he did not feel that he
was stealing from his stockholders; he was using their
money, he thought, as much to protect and preserve their
interests as if he were hiring a policeman or paying for
the services of an expert adviser. A man in such a position
has felt that he must protect the welfare of his company,
and that to him means, usually, to pay the largest
dividends possible. Like the ruler of the state, in many
cases he commits these acts with the greater zeal, altho
sometimes concealing the real motive even from himself,
because an increase in dividends makes his own position
more secure and often increases his own salary. He is
wrong; he has forgotten the still great( interest of the

Great progress has been made in the past twenty-five
years. Although the domesday survey mapped out in the
celebrated census of i88o was a notable achievement, the
range of observation since that date has been vastly extended.
We know how many eggs were laid in Alaska;
we measure the glass surface of florists' establishments;
we have laid bare the balance sheets of the counting room;
in our census we distinguish between one and two-seated
sleighs; we can tell the proportion of checks to other
monetary media; we know how much gold is consumed in
dentistry; we have explored the mysterious labyrinths of
monopolies and large industrial corporations; we have records
of accidents and strikes; we have studied analytically
the causes of poverty and degeneration; we have observed
the physical and mental condition of children and have
made record of the food they eat and of the hours they
sleep.
Activity in observation does not mean that the work is
well done, or that there is an intelligent consideration of
the means to an end. Notwithstanding the activity, we
are disposed to distrust the accuracy of much of the descriptive
and statistical data thus collected, and we seek
in vain for material which is wanting. Examples will be
readily called to mind. We are still in doubt as to the exact
changes in rates of wages for equivalent amounts of
work performed; we still have a misgiving as to the variations
in prices, although we freely admit that this is giving
way to confldence; we are still in the dark as to the cost of
production of the staples of consumption; we still are tin--
able to frame reliable survivorship tables for lack of statistics

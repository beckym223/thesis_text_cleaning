gaged in operations that have shocked the sense of justice
and honor and fair-dealing, seems out of harmony with
the general trend of social events. It was certainly not
to be expected that men who seem entirely conscientious
in all their dealings, public and private, men who apparently
in all private relations lead exemplary lives, men
who have won universal respect, should suddenly in their
business be found engaged in acts illegal and dishonorable.
JIn explanation there seems only one alternative:
either our standard of business integrity has changed; or
we have found difficulty in applying our former standards
to modern conditions.
Doubtless within the last decade in business positions
of importance weak men have been found who have
yielded to temptation. But many acts condemned by
public opinion have been committed by men who are not
weak and who apparently have had no sense of guilt.
The fact that there are weak or wicked men in business,
while true, is not sufficient as an explanation.
We are all creatures of custom; we generally drift
under the inertia of habit in thought as well as in action.
In consequence, changes in social or business conditions
take us unawares; we need time to readjust ourselves.
Meanwhile we do foolish and wrong things. The old ways
do not fit the new surroundings. Consider, for example,
the blind despair of the cotton weavers in England, when,

They did not understand; they could not foresee
the inevitable; and, in their foolish rage, they smashed
the machines. But they were no more foolish than are
many men of the present day who hope and expect to see
the business of railways and gas companies, natural monopolies,
regulated by competition. This mental or social

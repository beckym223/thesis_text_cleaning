for the commission of other acts less heinous than mur-
der in private morals, such as deception, bribery, obtain-
ing property under false pretenses, robbery. If it is
right for nations to fight for their national existence or
for their national honor, it is surely right, he urges, for
them f5o secure information regarding the strongholds,
or the military or naval equipment of the states with
which they may be brought into conflict, by bribing their
officers. If it is right in time of war to seize the terri-
tory of the enemy and keep it (a kind of highway rob-
bery) in order to have a better defense thereafter
for the home territory, it is surely right to obtain
the same territory for similar purposes by wilfully
creating a misunderstanding about a boundary line and
insisting upon it. Acts such as these I am not defending;
but they are, as a matter of fact, condoned when com-
mitted by statesmen. in many cases they are even looked
upon as praiseworthy.
Without judging these questions now, note the applica-
bility of these principles to modern business life. When
a great corporation magnate feels himself a trustee for
the interests of his thousands- of stockholders, in some
instances more numerous than the citizens of some of the
smaller states, he finds himself tempted to business acts
which he would reject without hesitation in his private
capacity. The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New
York, for example, has some 6ooooo policy-holders
whose interests doubtless touch closely not less than
3,000,000 people, i. e., more than the population of Den-

tious in their private relations, have often not hesi-
tated to bribe and to use all kinds of -deceit to win
an election, and have excused their acts on the

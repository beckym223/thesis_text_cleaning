for the commission of other acts less heinous than murder
in private morals, such as deception, bribery, obtaining
property under false pretenses, robbery. If it is
right for nations to fight for their national existence or

creating a misunderstanding about a boundary line and
insisting upon it. Acts such as these I am not defending;
but they are, as a matter of fact, condoned when committed
by statesmen. in many cases they are even looked
upon as praiseworthy.

Without judging these questions now, note the applicability
of these principles to modern business life. When
a great corporation magnate feels himself a trustee for
the interests of his thousands- of stockholders, in some
instances more numerous than the citizens of some of the
smaller states, he finds himself tempted to business acts
which he would reject without hesitation in his private

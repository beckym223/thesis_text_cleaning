hands, provided the individuals concerned could make of
the business a matter of personal profit. For this reason
the coinage of money is considered a function of sovereignty.
Banks are put more strictly than most other lines
of industry under government control. In our own country,
since education is looked upon as the foundation of
good government, our schools have become public schools
and the element of personal profit has been almost entirely
eliminated from our educational system. It may seem
odd to class schools with industries, but some schools, I
fear, grind out graduates for profit. Still schools run
for private profit now occupy a very subordinate position
and are to be considered only as supplementary to
our public schools for the benefit of those who have
liberal means of support. The extension of our postoffice
facilities into remote country districts, where the
receipts do not nearly cover expenses, is justified on the
same grounds. The cheap and rapid transmission of
information, as a means of education, must be carried
even into districts where a private corporation could not
afford to do the work.
THOSE REQUIRING GREAT CAPITAL WITH RETURNS LONG
DELAYED.
e. 3. In earlier times, before the financial resources of
the leading countries were so great, and before the corporation
as a method of business organization had become
common, all enterprises requiring great capital had to be
in the hands of the government in order that the resources
of the country could be tapped by taxation to
undertake them. Under modern conditions in Europe
and America this is no longer necessary, but wherever
the returns from the investment are only remote, governments
still sometimes need to undertake such enterprises.

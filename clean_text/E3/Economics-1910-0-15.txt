of the process of observation is for governments to put
the work into the hands of scientists, or at least to call
them into consultation. It may be said, however, that
the simple collection of economic facts does not require
the services of experts trained in economic analysis; that
the gathering of data in regard to production, prices, consumption,
etc., demands intelligent and honest administrative
effort, but not necessarily a specialized economist.
The objection is ill-advised; the economist and the sociologist
ought to make their influence felt at every stage
from original observation to final generalization. Because
of this neglect at the initial step, we are now swamped by
a mass of material which in part is rubbish, of no use to
anyone; in another part of so little use that it does not
justify the expense of collection; and which in still another
considerable portion is so inaccurate that it is open
to suspicion, and cannot be safely used for purposes
either of induction or deduction.
Suppose an economist should endeavor to frame a
scheme of facts which he requires for his economic generalization
and processes of reasoning, what facts would
he demand? Under present conditions he has at hand an
enormous mass of material supplied by statistical bureaus
which in order to justify their maintenance are not compelled
to meet an expert demand. They furnish data
which can be easily gathered together, or which will conform
to ideas of serviceability long since abandoned, or
which will make an impressive showing from the standpoint
of quantity. Let the economist go through the
mass of statistical documents and reports of commercial,
industrial, and charitable organizations, and direct his attention
solely to the question,t-in what way can this fact
be used, in what way is it of service, or in what way can
it be analyzed so that it will be of service in- the near future,

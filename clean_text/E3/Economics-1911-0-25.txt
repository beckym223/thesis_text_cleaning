and still more impossible rivers; would go for manufacturing
cannon which woul(d rust out and become worthless before they
should ever be used; would be spent in inaugurating a "world
policy" which was sure to come if the nation continued so great
and the revenue continued to grow.

I believe the same thing.is true today. One of the arguments,
in my mind, for the assumption of a part of the burden of national
education by the federal government is that if the federal government
assists more fully in bearing the burdens of the nation as
it ought to, it will not be tempted to add increased burdens to
the nation by wild policies of world adventure, to which it will
be tempted in ever increasing extent, as national revenue and
therefore the possibility of such interference increases.
Friends, if we could secure the establishment in our day and
generation of such a comprehensive system of national education
-namely, one which would reach every child, white, black, yellow,
rich, and poor, and discover and call forth all his capabilitiesand
then a system which would go farther and privide for the
training of those abilities to the highest possible point, the nation
would enter upon a period of increase of national wealth the like
of which has never been seen in the history of the world. When all
the abilities of the community have an opportunity to be developed
and to be employed in the service of the community and in the
development of civilization; when the attention of the nation is
concentrated upon the development of its own people first of all,
and not upon world domination, not upon world influence, not even
primarily upon world service, but upon the development of its own
people and their capacities; then we shall see a new heaven and a
new earth; and when we set before ourselves as a nation the problem
of developing the bodies, the brains, and the character of our
children to the highest degree of perfection, all these other things
national wealth, world influence, and world power-shall be
added unto us.

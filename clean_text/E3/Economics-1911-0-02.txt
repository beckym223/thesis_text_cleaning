service. It is a source of still greater satisfaction that they have
all made good in this field of work. Hadley, Emory, Jenks,
Falkner, Rowe, Johnson, Kinley, are mere examples of a growing
tendency which is full of promise for the future of economic studies
and sound public policy.
At the time this Association was organized I felt that in the
interest of economic and social progress there would be a decided
advantage if economists could elaborate and support a positive
program of economic and social advance.
My colleagues with whom I was associated in the preliminary
and final work of organization did not share my views and this
Association has remained, therefore, primarily a scientific body,
pure and simple. I do not know, after all, that it has made any
very great difference, and yet I am still of the opinion today,
as I was then, that if our students of economics and politics and
social science could find any questions of public moment and
interest upon which they are in substantial agreement we might
make a marked contribution to economic and social advance by
taking a definite stand upon such questions of public policy. This
consummation has indeed already been brought about in certain
directions by the organization of specific associations for the study
and promotion of positive economic and social problems; as, for
instance, the Association for Labor Legislation which has grown
out of this Association.
I think, however, that if the members of this Association could
agree, for example (to take a concrete instance), upon the proper
distribution of public and private expenditure in relation to
national production and could work out a definite policy which
would commend itself to the members of the Association, directed
toward securing a more productive distribution of public expenditure,
we might, without doing violence to our scientific character,
produce a marked effect upon public sentiment and in the long run
upon public policy.
For instance, no matter what theory we may have as to the
social effects of war and the political advantage or disadvantage
of settling questions of international scope by force, I think all
students of economics agree that the modern world is -spending an
unreasonably large portion of the national wealth for purposes of
war and preparation for war. No matter how high a value one
may set upon the so-called moral benefits arising from an armed
struggle among different nations to determine the survival of

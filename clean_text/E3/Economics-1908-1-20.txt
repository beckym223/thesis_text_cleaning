but they will be blameworthy, if they delay, and
the Government does well to stimulate their activity.
SUMMARY.
I2. It would be beyond my purpose at the present time
to apply these general principles to specific cases in the
United States, and to give my opinion as to exact rules
that the Government should lay down or as to the
industries which the public should own or control. I
consider only a few general principles. This much may
be said in summary. In the discussion of such questions
as public control of public service corporations we ought
not to be swayed at all by the fear that we shall be called
either socialists or scientific anarchists. We should recognize
that there is mnuch truth in the teachings of those
who advocate government ownership and management;
perhaps an equal amount of truth in the teachings of
those who advocate the let-alone policy carried to the
extreme. The public and scientific thinkers owe a debt
to both classes. It is our duty to judge each individual
case on its own merits, taking into account local conditions,
industrial, political, and personal. Moreover, we
should recognize the fact that society and political institutions
are changing and progressing and that a policy
wise to-day may be unwise twenty years hence; that a
policy successful in Europe will probably not be equally
successful here; that in no case can we accept as conclusive
the experience of others or even our own present experience;
and that on the whole the government probably
needs to extend its control especially over the larger companies,
unless their managers take the ptiblic more fully
than now into their confidence. In every case our final
appeal is to common sense, good judgment, and an unselfish
regard for the public welfare.

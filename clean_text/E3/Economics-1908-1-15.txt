various ways and under differ-ing circumnstances will
show that for the present at an-y rate such instanlces are,
relatively speakin-g, rare. Wherever it is miade clearly
probable that the policy of public managemenlt is wise, it
shouldl be adopted; but it would be unwise to declare offhand
that all capitalistic enterprises at any time in any
future, however remote, can best be managed by the
state. It is unsound even to put that forward as a
desirable end. The end looked for is the welfare of the
citizens. Wherever and whenever that can best be secured
by public ownership anld 1nanagement there can be
no objection to such form of enterprise. Under present
conditions such a policy is relatively seldom wise, for
both economic and political reasons. The burden of
proof in each case rests upon those advocating it.
AND TOWARDS ANARCHY.
The other extreme of governmental policy, scientific
anarchy, or the practical abandonment of all governmental
conltrol, is still less often possible; but we may
freely concede that either socialism or scientific anarchism
in special ages and in special countries might be wise.
CONTROL BY COMMISSIONS OR INSPECTORS.
8. Less rigid and less difficult than direct management
is the control that governments may have in connection
with the system of private enterprise. A legislature or
the executive may lay down fixed rules for certain lines
of industry, and a commission or an inspector may apply
these rtules in special cases. We have in many states
railway commissions and bank inspectors whose work is
largely judicial in nature. This kind of work does not
demand so ambitious a talent, nor a talent so high-priced,
although the judicial gift is no less useful to the public,
and possibly no less rare than those of the captains of

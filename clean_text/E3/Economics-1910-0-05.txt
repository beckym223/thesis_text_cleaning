accurate observation is a desirable object of educational
effort, and that the student should receive some
instruction which will enable him to recognize and classify
the facts of economic life. And it is here that
writers of systematic treatises might very properly in
their introductory chapters place greater emphasis upon
the character and service of observation. As a rule, our
text-books dwell uponl definitions, methods of reasoning,
the relative value of deduction and induction, the application
of mathematical ideas, and the scope of economics
as distinguished from cognate sciences; but give very litthe
attention, if any, to the part which observatioln plays,
its importance and its limitations.
The instructor has at least one, if not all, of three ends
in view: (i) The development of mental power on the
part of the student irrespective of the acquisition of any
particular facts; (2) the acquisition of a certain nLumber
of useful facts in regard to the business world, irrespective
of their ifumediate relation to general prinlciples;
and (3) a mastery of the principles and a knowledge of
the facts so that the future citizen can apply himself with
some degree of gratification to himself, and some degree
of benefit to the world, in the explanation of economic
problenms as they press upon him; At present these aims
are imnperfectly met. It is generally acknowledged, I believe,
by teachers that the method of instruction is unsatisfactory,
and, in so far as the instructor follows the
text-book, the student too frequently agrees with this
judgment. This is a natural consequence of existing conditions.
The student by previous training is unable to assimilate
the psychological generalizations dogmaticallv
assumted in the text-book exposition; and the facts which
are supplied by the instructor at irregular ilntervals, in
unequal doses ranging from a single phenomenon to a

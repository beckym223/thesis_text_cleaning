In the strict sense, the title Mr. George and his party
have adopted, is a misnomer. The assumption by the
State, for its own uses, of the economic rent of land,
does really not constitute a tax at all. It is merely
the exercise of one of the lucrative prerogatives of the
State. Properly speaking, as I esteem it, (1) something
of the idea of contribution according to ability
to pay; (2) something of the notion of universality
of exaction; (3) something of an admission that the
State is taking for its uses what otherwise the individual
would have a perfect right to enjoy; (1) something
of an expectation that the burden will, in the
end, be spread, more or less imperfectly, over the
whole community, on whomsoever it in the first
instance falls, underlie every real tax.
But in the case of "the confiscation of rent by
taxation," to use Mr. George's expression, the right
of the State to make the exaction is not put at all
upon the ground of ability to contribute. Indeed, in
his controversy with Dr. Seligman, before the Social
Science Association at Saratoga, last summer, Mr.
George argued strongly against the notion of contribution
according to ability.
Again, in the Single Tax there is no pretence of
universality of exaction. The subject taken for imposition
is single, specific; and no citizen is assessed
except as he comes into relation to this. Again, in
the Single Tax there is entirely lacking anything
like an admission that the State is taking for its
necessary purposes that which otherwise the individual
would have a perfect right to enjoy. To the
contrary of this, it is asserted that the individual
has no right whatever to "the unearned increment"
of the soil of which he may be in possession; that,

sources of food supply for the civilized world; what will
be the process by which the old countries fall back
again to their own resources,-if indeed they do fall
back,-these are questions which the statesmen of the
present day had best leave to the distant successors who
may eventually have to deal with them.

A curious argument, connected with this set of considerations,
has been advanced by one of the most distinguished
economists of our time. A revival of the
more extreme phase of the Malthusian reasoning, it
looks to the influence of more abundant food supplies on
the growth of population and the standard of living.
Briefly, the reasoning is that cheaper food will simply
cause an increase of numbers, and a lowering of the
standard of living. When food thereafter becomes
dearer, either in occasional seasons of dearth or-as is
supposed to be probable-as a permanent matter in the
not distant future, there will be nothing to fall back on.
The larger population which the temporary period of
plenty had called out, will suffer the more when the
conditions of limited supply return. This is just what
Malthus maintained a century ago. But, it is also just
what a century of economic and social history has disproved.
I am by no means of the opinion that the century'
s history has disproved the general Malthusian
theorem,-the tendency to pressure and the need of
restraint. But the particular corollary as to the inexpediency
of cheaper food seems to be quite untenable.
The causes of restraint or lack of restraint in multiplication
are much more complex than it assumes. Notable
among them are the advance of education and intelligence,
the nature of the industrial organization, the desire
and opportunity to rise in the social scale, which
Malthus himself believed to be the vis medica/rix of

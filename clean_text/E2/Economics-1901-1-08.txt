Tlais argument has, however, a certain practical weight
alld is llearcR most often, perhaps, al:llong business men
thetnselves. It is, llowes7er, the satne old objection rhicll
has been raisecl at,ain.st lligher eclucatioll in every clepartrnellt,
viz.: that young men slloulcl begin with the
A, B, C, of the business or professioll in practical life
rather than svaste tlaeir time oll tlleoretical courses in
college. Tlle olcl-fashiollecl svay to study meclicine was
to begin by harnessitlg up tlle doctor's llorse, as lle preparecT
to go his rounds, following tllis up by takirlg
medicille to the patiellts, alld vasllillg alld cleallillg tlle
mortars and pestles used in their preparation. The lawyer
began by eopying papers, and tlle nlercllatlt by
sweeping Ollt tlle snop; the book-lDinclillg apprentice, b),r
waslling tlle dinner clishes for tl-le housewife, etc. But
this idea has alreadr beell g-ivell up iu the case of cel--
tain itllportant callings, and tnust gradually disappear in
the case of tnany otllers.l
As to tlle secoolcl pOillt, tl-lere is llncloubtedly sozne
danger tllat tlle yollllg lllell wl-lo spelld from seven to
eight years in the study of Ivatin, Greek and matllematics,
(>r even in the study of Frencll and Gertlan, alld llatural
science, may acquire, if not a taste for literary callillgs, at
least a distaste for mercantile life. But this cloes llot t,)rove
that the pursuit of a llighel- course of study, which sl-loulcR
be related more closely to their future xvork w0111cl have
the same effect. The study of the history alld methods
of insurance, for example, in all their different aspects,
need llot of itself destroy all illterest of youllg
men in the business of insurance as a practical career;
on the contrary, it woulcl very probalDly inerease the

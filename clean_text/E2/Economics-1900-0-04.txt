Or1 the other halld, a man's theory of prosperity is
closely interwoven witll his theories of ethics alld of
politics. Moral and political stalldards are a determining
element in our judgtnent as to whether a nation's
aggregate conditioll is goocl or bad. Observatioll as to
the effect of diflerent industrial systeIns on the stability
or destruction of a nation reacts, in turn, upon our
moral and political jlldgments. It is at tl-lis point tllat
the interactioll between economics and politics, whether
by way of ulutual aid or mutual criticislll, is ollOSt conSta
11t. OI11Y occasionally and incidentally do our
theories of distribution leacl lIS to intervene in political
aHairs by showing that certain lines of legislation produce
different results from those whicll are contemplated.
Daily and hourly does our theory of prosperity lead us
to such intervelltion, whell we believe that the aitns of
a certain group of moralists or politicians are destructive
to the well-being of the natioll as a whole.
At this point, where the possibility of illfluence is
greatest, the difficulty which meets the economist who
strives to maintain a dispassionate ancl critical attitude is
also keenest. In his theory of distributiola he can
readily relnain a passive observer of facts. He can
measure ancl weigh the results of coznpetition, as lle can
measure and weigll the results of gravitation or of bioX
logical selectiorl; ancl can gtlard himself against error
in fact or deduction by the sall-le methocls which are
used by the physicist or the biologist for the sallle purpose.
Bllt whell he comes to measure the aggregate
merit of the total result, lle has a different task and a
far harder one.
I said a year ago, and I still believe, that even in this
task the scientific knowledge possessed by the economist
enables him to cotne nearer to its ftllfillment than can

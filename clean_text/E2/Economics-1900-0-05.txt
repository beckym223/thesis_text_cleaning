his fellow members of the comlllllnity; tllat ill this field
of exceptional doubt he should ulldertake to realize the
very higllest icleals as a scielltific mall wllo stands above
the clouds of prejudice, and therefore sees farther than
tllose about llim; that it is his higll mission to be the
repre.seoltative alld the chatllpion of the permanent interests
of the whole cotntnullity, in the face of conflicting
clailus from representatives of telnporary or partial
ones.
This view of the IlliSSiOll alld tlle duties of the political
econoluist has been challenged on tllree grounds: as
bad psychology, bad politics, and bad etllics. We are
told, in the first place, tllat as a lnatter of practical psychology,

case was such disinterestedlless sufficieolt to protect them
frorn obliquities of moral vision whicll led to diametrically

prosperity. A man may have tlle intentioIl to be impartial,
and may be perfectly canclid in the belief that

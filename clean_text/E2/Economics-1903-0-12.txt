In the strict scientific sense, capital has indeed existed
from the time of the first hunter's bow and arrow. But
for practical purposes and for real aid in solving actual
problems, the common man is perfectly justified in
calling this the capitalistic age, just as Karl Marx was
entirely correct in employilag the word " capital " to
describe the essential modern phenomenon. The economist
calls attention to the fact that capital in the
generic sense Inay be put into land, into trade, or into
industry; but to the illterpreter of social forces the
typical fortn of capital to-day is industrial capital, as in
feudal times it was landed capital, alad as in so lnany
civilizations of old it was trade capital. We have only
lately been remincled that classic Greece, for itlstance,
had its beginnings, its middle ages, and its modern titnes.
But in anciellt Greece, even at the height of its power,
slave labor was the chief factor in production, and illdustry
was predominantly of the small, non-capitalistic
type. Again, the medixval guild systeon of industry
was in almost esZery respect a contrast to our modern
regime. The land problern is no doubt stil] important
in a country like ours where seventy per cent of the
exports are agricultural; the commercial prolDlem is
still important in a country like ours whicll is seeking
to secure its share in the trade of the newly opened
Orient. But were we to read the signs aright, we should
realize that in our case, as in tllat of all our great coznpetitors,
the secret of ultimate success is to be sought,
not in the land question, not in ollr trade relations, but
in the fundatnelltal conditions of industrial eIlterprise at
home. Industrial capital as distinct frotn agricultural
ol commercial capital is a product of modem times; it
has never before existed as the tolle-giving element of
society; it is destilled to produce very diflerent conse-

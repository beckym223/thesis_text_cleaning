tions of the " chosen peoples "; and we regard the attitude
of the ancient Jews and of the classic Greeks
toward gentile and barbarian respectively as the perfectly
explicable, but none the less culpable, result of an
overweening pride and vainglory, buttressed in the one
case by the all-pervading power of religion, and in the
other by the fanciful supports of ancestry. We can with
diHiculty repress a smile of amusement when confrollted
to-day by the rival demands of those mighty lnonarchs
who still profess to rule br " the grace of God," and who
are unwilling to submit their differellces to the arbitrament
of anything less tllall the "nalaifest destiny" of
their own flesh and blood. We are evell ready at the
present tilne ill the matter of international tllorality to
collcede that while there is a beam in the eyes of our
neigllbors, there Inay possibly be at all evellts a tllote in
our own.
When, however, we come to a consideration of economic
phenotnena and their influence on our social and
political fact and theory, we do llot recognize that we
have been largely living in a fool's paradise. We think
with complacency that there is somethillg illllerent in
our democracy; we look back upon the achievemellts of
our coloniaI struggles as ttle obvious consequence of the
Puritall character; we congratulate ourselves upon our
love of liberty, our inventive ingenuity, our utlexalupled
prosperity. What we do not see is the essential relativity
of all these phenotnena, the dependellce of thetn
all on the shifting conditions of time and place.
New England indeed developed its democracy and its
town meeting. But the town uleeting had its prototype
in the woods of Germany, on the steppes of Asia, and in
fact in all pritnitive assemblages; while the democracy
was the result, not of the Puritan alacestry, but of the

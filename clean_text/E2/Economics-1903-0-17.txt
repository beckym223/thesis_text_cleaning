A stud; of the econoznic forces now at work thus justifies
a reasonable hopefulness. Tlle productinre powers of
society are augmenting at such a prodigious rate that we
need 1lo longer apprehelld a decay of general prosperity
or of natural power. There is to be no fl1rtller irruption
of the barbarian, because there will soon be no more
barbarians. There is to be no swinging back of the
pendulum of civilization, because uncler the inlqllence of
the new economic forces ollly those nations can succeed
that understalld how to utilize indllstrial capital, and
this comprehension inlplies an ever ascendillg stage of
civilization. There is to be no dotllinatioll of each llation
in turn over all the others, because of the inter-llationality
of science and the impartial territorial diSusion of
illclustrial agencies. Ancl within each nation, while the
rich are gettillg richer, the poor are not getting poorer.
The creation of a ulore equable, because a lllore perfect,
competitioll throllgh the development of the systenl of
collective bargaining and the lnore adequate supervision
of monopoly; the recognition oll the part of the legislator
that lastillg prosperity depends not only on the
conservation and free play of capital bl1t on the gradl1al
elevation of tlle laborer frorn a cheap man to a dear man;
the coming social control of coznpetition itself in the interests
of a ulore ellliglltened and 11ence really freer
rivalry, all these will inevitably tend to secure to each
class in the comlnullity its proper share in the natiollal
dividencl.

This is not fatalism. This is not the preaching of
" hands off." Far from it ! Man is a product of history,
but history is luade by man. Modern economic forces
indeecl provide new opportunities for all. But whether
the correct use be made of the opportunities depellds on
the wisdom, the energy, the capacity of each individual,

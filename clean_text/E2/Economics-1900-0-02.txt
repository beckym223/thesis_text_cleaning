of the American Economic Association that modern
political econotny contains two distinct pal-ts often inextricably
intermingled ill fact, yet always separate in
principle a theory of distribution and a theory of prosperity.
The theory of distribution shows how the public
wealth is divided amollg the different members of
the community. It shows what are tlle effects of a system
of laws or a group of comlllercial conditiolls on the
relative well-being of the different classes concerned.
It tries to predict how changes in these laws will increase
the Illaterial cornfort of some individuals and
diminisll that of others. The theory of prosperity, oll
the other hand, is concerned primarily with the good or
evil of the nation as a whole. It deals with aggregate
results rather than witll individual olles, and concerns
itself with the separate parts otlly as they must be
studied in order to understand that aggregate effect.
The distinction between these two sets of theories is
not quite the same as that between static and dynalllic
econolllics; for a considerable part of the theory of distribution
deals with dyllamic problems with effects
which are essentially the result of industrial progress
rather than of static adjusttnent. It Inuch ollore nearly
coincides with the old antithesis between deductive and
historical schools. It may perhaps fairly be said to be
a precise statement of a distinction for which the earlier
znembers of the historical school were feeling, but wllich
they failed to grasp or formulate in precise fashion a
failure which reacted seriously upon the influence of
this school ill matters of economic controversy. Be this
as it may, the distinction is a real and permanent otle.
WIen may agree absolutely in their theories of distribution
and disagree SoSo coelo in their theories of prosperity.
Marx, in his theory of distribution, followed

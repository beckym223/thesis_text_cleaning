compromise in which the interests of the part which
they represent shall have adequate recoanitioll. This
substitution of compromise for COllViCtiOll as the ideal
of legislative activity is perhaps the oreatest and most
pervasive evil ulader which our political machinery
suffers. It shows its effect ill the demoralizing principle
that the l-epreselltative sllould be guided ill his
utterallces alld his votes by the opiniolas of lliS COllstituellts,
rather tllall lDy lais own a prillciple which, ill
spite of all protests, has come to be gelzerally accepted
in practical politics. It deprives the member of the
legislature of the educatiollal illfluence incidellt to his
pOSitiOtl. It makes llim an agent llot only of his district,
but of his party within his clistrict. It mallifests
its results in appropriatioll bills, where the Inembers
who stalld up for the general illterest of the treasury are
illcreasingly rare, and those wllo luake claillls for tlle
expenditure of molley on bellalf of their localities alld
often oll behalf of private interests witllin their localities
beconle constantly louder. It shows itself evell in
gelleral legislatioll, where the character of llloderll
statutes as a patcllwork of private demallds llas become
only too llotoriotls.
All this has gone so far as to produce a cllange ill tlle
public estilnate of parliamelltary bodies. The glorificatioll
or idealizatioll of the legislature, so cotnlllon in
g-eneratiolls illlmediately golle by, is rapidly passillg
away. Ill matters of municipal governmellt we are lessellilag
the application of tlle old represeoltative systemgiVillg
lllore power to the lnayor and those persolls appointed
by the tllayor, alld less to the represelltatives of
the several districts; because, with tlle amount of busi-
-ness that is done by the ordillary lnunicipality, we cannot
afford to let the gelzeral illterests of tlle xvhole be

We grasp the form, but not the substance. We think
that we appreciate the social basis of economic law, but
in reality our appreciation is fragmentary. We do the
theory lip-service, but not brain-homage. We are oblivious
of its real significance. Because of this, in some
of the basic questions of economic theory there are discord

Because of this, in some of the most important questions
of applied economics, we are floundering about,
tossed on the stormy sea of doubt without rudder or
compass. Because of this, some of the current and
seemingly fundamental doctrines of public finance are
in reality erroneous, or at least impotent to explain
modern tendencies or to afford any satisfactory clue to
the solution of modern difficulties. By their fruits shall

This is a severe and comprehensive indictment. You
will accordingly expect me to substantiate these charges,
at least so far as it is possible to do so within the limits
of a single address.

The contrast between the social and the individual
point of view has recently been made familiar to us in
allied domains. Take, for instance, the whole range of
ethical inquiry. Without entering at all upon the
deeper problems of transcendental origins and supraniundane
sanctions, and limiting ourselves to a consideration

ethics, that the morality of the individual has been
fashioned by the morality of the social group, and that
the very conception of right and wrong, so far as it is of
human origin at all, is the product of social, not of individual,
forces. The weakness of the early utilitarian

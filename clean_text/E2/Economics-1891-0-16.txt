use of such paper as money, our own economists
have, instead of stigmatizing it as bad money, asserted
that it was not money at all. In so. doing,
they have gone against the common sense and the
actual sight of the people. Every man who is not
blinded by prejudice knows that greenbacks are
money, just as much as silver or gold; bad money, if
you please so to consider it, injurious, pernicious,
anything you like, but money all the same.
In thus going against the common sense of the
people, the professional economists have impaired
their influence, in other directions, over the public
mind. Nor has the error I have indicated been a
merely incidental, and, in its evident import, a
trivial one. These writers have insisted upon making
their definition of money a test of economic
orthodoxy. They have forced this view upon the
popular attention urgently and aggressively. They
have not only departed from the reasonable position
of their English colleagues, as stated, but, in their
zeal to put down the forms of money they disliked,
thev have abandoned their own. fundamental principle
of value, declaring that the cost price of the gold
in the coin measures the cost price of the goods for
which it is exchanged, as a yardstick measures
length and a bushel capacity, forgetting for the time
all about such things as supply and demand.
Worse than this, as a means of forfeiting public
confidence, those who have assumed to be preeminently
the exponents of sound monetary doctrine
have uniformly disparaged the importance of a full
supply of money. In the greenback contests from
1868 to 1876, while attributing to inflation the direst
evils that can afflict a State, they declined to give

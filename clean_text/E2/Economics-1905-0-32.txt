and foreign markets, rejected though they have been in
all respectable economic writing, emerge again and
again. They will not down, and create a set of prepossessions
favorable to the adoption of protectionist legislation.
But in European countries (for the moment, I
have not the United States in mind) its actual adoption
has heen immensely promoted by two other factors. One
is the competition of new countries in agricultural products.
The other is the growth and intensification of
national feeling.

The effect of the competition of new countries is obvious
enough. With the cheapening of transportation,
not only England, but France, Germany, and the other
countries of Western Europe, have been invaded by supplies
of cheaper food and raw materials. The agricultural
classes have felt the pressure of foreign competitionFormerly
indifferent or even hostile to high tariffs, they
have now been led to join in the demand for protection
against cheaper foreign supplies. In England the agricultural
interest has always been restive under free
trade. In France and Germany, with the new democratic
conditions, its influence now constitutes a strong
political force against the application of that doctrine.
Not less important, however, is the sentiment of
nationality and its unfortunate counterpart, to the sentiment
against foreigners. Of the ennobling and beneficent
effect of national feeling I need not here speak.
Its less favorable aspects unfortunately are most conspicuous
in relation to our present subject. Cobden and
the other English free-traders of half-a-century ago looked
forward to a coming era of peace among nations,
strengthened by the links of friendly exchange and
mutual benefit. How sadly have these hopes been disappointed?
Militarism is no less strong than it was,

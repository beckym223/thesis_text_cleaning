als; and who have, until very recently, held to the
orthodox view that the money supply will take care
of itself, so far as a deficiency is concerned, and that
the only thing to be dreaded is inflation, have suddenly
broken down in the strangest way, not only
losing their spirit of resistance to the demand for a
large and arbitrary increase of silver coinage, but
appearing, in not a few cases, to be actually desirous
that it shail take place. Many who, a few months
ago, denounced the increase from two millions to four
and a half millions of silver dollars, a month, as suicidal
folly, are now contemplating without apparent
alarm, if not with complacency, the increase of the
monthly coinage to seven millions, or even free
coinage..
Whatever may have been the main motive in producing
this change of position with reference to an
increase of the money supply, on the part of many of
those who formerly called themselves; with much
unction, the friends of "honest money," there is little
doubt in my mind that the absence of a sufficient
resisting or retarding force, at the present time, is
largely due to the highly illogical and inconsistent
views of the money-function and the money-thing,

inconvertible notes, however fully and freely circulating,
were not and could not become money: a position
which Prof. Henry Sidgwick declares no English
economist of reputation has taken. Deprecating the

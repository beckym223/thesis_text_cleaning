grooves of habit. The established tradition, in our
American life is that the captain of industry has no ambition
and finds no opportunity in public life. If he
wishes permanent power, lasting distinction, continuous
achievement, he turns to fortune-building in private
industry.

The conditions of the case have indeed evolved a
peculiar sort of one-man power in public affairs, and have
drawn into political life a familiar type of the masterful
man. Such is the party boss, who enjoys power, and a
certain measure of distinction. The mechanism of government
is so unwieldy that those who are within can
not control it; hence there has developed the boss, who
manages the apparatus from without. This can not be
done without skill, shrewdness, enterprise, and other such
qualities needed for any career of leadership. But it calls
also for methods distasteful to straight-forward and highminded
men. Your boss is indeed not always so black
as he is painted; there are political machinists entitled
to our respect. But the role is after all an underhand
one, a circumventing of the avowed plan arid intent of
the general will. It attracts the unscrupulous, and even
the well-intentioned man who essays it finds himself
almost inevitably impelled to fight the devil with fire.
Not infrequently a man who has achieved success as a
leader of industry turns to political activity. He then
usually becomes the manipulator and master of the party
machine, following almost of necessity the familiar
methods of intrigue, bargain, office-mongering, bribery.
The able man of the higher type is not drawn to such
doings, while on the other hand the competition in the
unsavory work has a demoralizing effect on those who
strive for political power.

The system of checks and balances is thus a strong
factor in preventing the most needed abilities from being
exercised in the public service. But it is not the only
factor, possibly not the most important one. The

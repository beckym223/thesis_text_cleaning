understalld tlle theoretieal and praetieal eonelusions
reaellecl by that pllilosophy. The probleln wllieh presentecl
itself to our forefatllers, and to Freneh statesmen,
as well as to English thinkers, was essentially llegative.
Restrietions onust be removed. Favoritism onust be
abolished, and the laws tnaking possible restrietions and
favoritislll must be repealed. The restrietions upon
liberty svllieh nvere tllen llotieecl ssZere restrietions of a
politieal nature. Collseqllently tlle probleln of liberty
was eoneeived to be essentially a politieal problem, as
well as a llegative one.
Closely assoeiated witl-l this cloetrille of equality was
the doetrille of the bellefieellee of self-illterest. Inaslnuell
as men were essentially equal, eaell olze eoulcl best
gElarCl lliS OWll interests individually, provicled only the
halllperillg fetters of the law sholllc1 maiSe way for a
reign of liberty. Tillle cloes not perlllit llle to follow
out, as I wolllcl like, the clevelopment of this negative
view of liberty, wlliell I have presented. Frotll it we
may traee ollt a very elearly onarked line of evollltion of
thougllt, ancl a solIlewhat less elearly markecl line of
evolution of politieal praetiee. Througll various
writers we reaeh Herbert Speneer's treatlllent of liberty
as a negative allci politieal probletn. The areat elleony
of freedoon, he holds, is the state tnanifesting itself ill
laws clireeting Iluman aetisTity, allcl ill his opinion, leading
illevitably to slavery, unless the flow of legislation
is in some way eheeked. We fincl Herbert Speneer
preaehing his doetrine of liberty in his " Soeial Staties "
in I85I, and asserting in it the right of man to clisregard
tTle state, ancl ila tnore reeent tilnes he expounds his
doetrine in artieles bearing sueh titles as these: "The
Cotning Slavery ", " Tlle Sins of Legislators ", " The
Great Political Superstition."

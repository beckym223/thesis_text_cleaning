the bottom of the abyss. All this time the trouble was
not want of capital, for the nation had never been so rich;
not the lack of credit in commercial relations, for the history
of the world may be searched in vain to find an equally
remarkable example of the readiness of merchants and
bankers to trust each other and to support each other,
even at the risk of their own fortunes. The trouble was
all in the sudden withdrawal of a portion of the nation's
money supply, due to distrust of financial legislation.
This was all, and this was enough to bring the United
States nearer to general ruin than it has been before since
the war made us a nation indeed.

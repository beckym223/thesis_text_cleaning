whereas in actual life we cannot reduce our bewildering
variety of imposts to the simple categories of taxes on
wages, rent and profits. Canard and his slender band of
followers went a step further in boldly proclaiming the
law of the general diffusion of taxes. But their exposition
failed to command assent because they overshot the
mark and overlooked the obvious cases where there is
no shifting at all. As a consequence, modern theory has
proceeded on the assumption that direct taxes at least
tend to stay where they are put, and that the ideals of
distributive justice are to be attained by an equitable apportionment
of such direct charges on the individuals.
It is high time that we realize the fallacy underlying
this assumption. As a matter of fact our complex modern
industrial society has rendered necessary a transition
from the individual to the social point of view, and calls
for a study of taxation based on the existence of econonic
law.
In such a study the two chief factors must be the
shifting and the capitalization of taxation. Each of
these has been more or less touched upon by previous
thinkers, but no effort has yet been made to bring them
into harmonious cooperation.
Capitalization is now a familiar conception. If a tax
of one per cent is imposed on a corporate five per cent
bond, previously selling at par, then if the bonds of
other classes of corporations are not taxed the man who
buys this bond will pay only $8o for it; le gets $5
interest and pays $i in taxes, and his net return of $4
bears the same proportion to $8o that the former net return
of $5 bore to $Ioo. In other words, the tax is
capitalized into the difference of the market value of the
bond, and the new purchaser who advances the money

indirect taxation is theoretically opposed to the doctrine
of equality, in the country as a whole the revenue from
indirect taxation is a continually increasing proportion
of the total income. And if it is claimed that at all
events our modern taxation of corporations is a step in
the direction of greater equality, do you not see that the
real tax-payers are not these fictitious entities which are
called corporations, but the human beings that compose
them ? Taxation of the corporation is not taxation of
the individual security holder. for the majority of the
securities ill great classes of our corporations are in the
hands of the bond-holders who are not touched by the
tax; since in ev ery solvent corporation the payment of the
stipulated interest is deemed a fixed charge, taking
precedence of the payment of taxes. Wherever we
turn the facts seem to give the lie to the doctrine of
ability.

What is the explanation of this curious state of affairs ?
Are we really going to the bad ? Have we lost our grip
on the cardinal principles of justice ? Or is the fault to
be ascribed to the theory rather than to the facts. And
if so, where shall we look for its weakness, and what is
the new doctrine that is capable of interpreting the
facts, and of clearing up the mnist ill which the whole
subject is enshrouded.

To these queries I would answer: our American developmlient
is based not on injustice, but on justice ; it is
moving ill the righlt, not in the wrong direction ; it is in
accord with, not in opposition to, the real economic law.
If the current theory does not harmonize with the facts,
so much the worse for the theory. In truth we have
been living ill a fool's paradise. We have accepted from
the European writers, and have developed with wearisome
iteration, a doctrine which is not only in flat contradiction

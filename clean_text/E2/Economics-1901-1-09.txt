student's interest itl the subjeet, alld the knowledge of
its wider bearings migllt well lighten the burden of its
routine, as well as sharpen the intelleet in its purstlit,
and in so far qualify tlle eanclidate for everl the more
teehnieal sicles of the work.
As to the third objeetioll on the part of eollege men,
that there is no well reeognized eurrieulum whieh ean
with a good eonseienee be reeomnlenclec1 to a youllg tnan
as likely to qllalify him better for his busil-less life9 we
nlust adlnit that this proposition llas been true down to a
eomparatively reeent period, and is even yet in large measure
true. But tllis has been the ease in the early history
of all professiollal and teehnieal stucRy. Compare the
eurrieululll of tlle law sehool at Harvarcl to-clay with
that of tlle first law sehool ill the eountry, or the present
medieal sehool in Harvard with the beginning of this
sehool a eentury ago, or present day teehnieal trainillg
witll the eurrieulum for the first sehools of teehnology.
We llave not, it must be adlnitted, worked out as yet
any body of doetrine or group of studies, theoretieal or
praetieal, whieh will eompare favorably with the systel-n
applied to law, medicine, theology or eng-ineering.
But we have at least the beginning of sueh a eurrieululll,
and, even, as it is, a eourse worth the while of young
men to take who desile to learn sometlling of the history
and wider bearings of tlleir future eallings; indeed,
something whiell it is worth their while to take as a
mere elelnent in a liberal edueation, if nothillg else.
And in any ease, we must begin at sol-ne time to work
out sueh a eurriellluln, and wl-ly not now as well as ever ?
But the present remarkable development has eome
about not only beeause our eolleges anc1 universities
have begun to reaeh out, c1riven by the law of their own
internal development, to enter this new and unoeeupied

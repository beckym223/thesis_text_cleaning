possible the practical as well as the theoretical sides of
insurance, bankillg and similar departlllents of illdustry.
I Snd, alnong others, the foliowillg sul:jects alreacly
offered in tlle cllrricula establislled ill tllese llew departnellts:
ecollomic geography, llistory of coml-nerce, business
organizatioll and managemellt, comlllercial law,
transpol-tatioll, money and bankillg, ulaterials of commerce,
colltracts, personal property, tlleol-y of accounts,
aucliting, illsurance, statistics, corporatioll finallce.
I neecl not here go into ally further detail; I desire

sorlle of our ulliversities, wllich llave ilg the xvide range
of tlleir elective studies a g,reat lnally of tllese eleluents
svl1icll I llave l-llentiolaecl, refuse to regarcl it as clesirable
to aclcl tlle other subjects wllich I have suagested, or
to call attelltioll to tlle fact tllat they ofier facilities wllich
would be worth the while of oung rnen to take ad-

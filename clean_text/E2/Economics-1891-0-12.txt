altogether irrespective of the needs of the State, his
enjoyment of that sum of wealth would constitute
an injustice and a grievance; and that right will
only be done, when government, acting for the
whole community, whose exertion, and sacrifices
have created that sum of wealth, shall take it entire,
if not for public uses, then for redistribution.
Finally, the idea of diffusion, or repercussion, is
entirely wanting from the Single Tax. By the very
nature of the case, the occupier of the soil can recoup
himself at the expense of the general community for
no share whatsoever of that which the State thus
takes. Inasmuch as economic rent forms no part of
the price of agricultural produce or of manufactured
products; inasmuch as it is obtained by no deduction
from wages, by no sacrifice of normal interest,
but represents wholly and solely a surplus in the
value of the product over the cost of production
upon the more fortunate lands, this imposition cannot
be carried over, by the processes of exchange, to
rest upon the consumer, upon the laborer, or upon
the capitalist. It remains where it first falls, upon
the owner of the land.

For these reasons I must regard the title, Single
Tax, as misleading. Were all lands to be assessed
for the benefit of the Treasury, that would constitute
a tax proper, The element of universality would be
present. The State would assume the attitude of
taking for its purposes that which the individual
would otherwise have an. unquestionable right to
enjoy. That taking would become a true tax, which
would tend, and tend strongly, towards diffusion and
repercussion, since a tax on all lands would increase
the cost of all production, and would raise the price of

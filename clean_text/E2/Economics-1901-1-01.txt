The onovement ill this country for college allcl llniversity
traillillg for the futul-e bllsiness man seems to
have entered within tlle last year or two upon a new era
in its llistory. Twenty years ago, when I first began to
insist tllat our business classes stood in lleed of higher
special or professional educatiol], alld tllat this education
should be given in ollr colleges ancl universities,
my voice was like that of one cryiIlg in the wilderness
ullheeded either ly the btlsilless world, oll the one hand,
or by the college svorld oll the otller.l
Evell up to witllill ten years ollly olle institutioll of
high rank had lDeen folllld willing to move ill this directiOll
alld to accord a half-hearted and tilnicl support to tlle
idea. To-day, at lea.st a clozen of ollr leading institutions,
and ill this list one-half dozell of tile most prominent inStitUtiOllS,
have decided to organize departlnents whose
prirllary fullctioll is that of furnislling a higher training
for colnlnercial life.

twenty years ago by the establishmellt of the Wharton
School of Finance ancl Econoxny ill I88I, though the
real work was not begun until I883.Â°

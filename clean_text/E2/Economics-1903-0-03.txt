the topics in which the great economists of the past delighted
were of a vital and engrossing characterj and
constituted the real, though often hidden, core of the
controversies of the day.
If, thell, economic science finds its justification in the
signiEcance of economic facts, if it owes its origin and
its fruitful development to the storm and stress of actual
life and to the inharmonious play of social forces, it
may-be worth while to consider somewhat more closely
the relations between economic thought and social
progress.
In the first place we must emphasize anew the essential
relativity of all economic thought and a11 political
doctrine. The philosopher indeed loves to elaborate
the eternal principles of order and harmony, and seeks
to give all mundane things their fixed place in the
cosmic scheme. With this the economist has no quarrel.
His work is the less ambitious one of seeking to put
various phases of the social activity of maol in their due
perspective, to estimate the real import of the economic
motive in its actual working out amid the myriad manifestations
of the social mind. In the narrower controversies
as to the nature of economic law, the battle between
absolutism and relativity has been virtually won.
Most thinkers are now willing to concede that however
accurate may be the conceptioll of inviolable law and
however legitimate may be the inclusion of econoznic
principle in this category, the law holds good only so
far as the conditiolls remain constant. With the perpetual
change in at least some of the relations of social
life, the economic law is often applicable only to the
particular stage of industrial development, and becomes
a provisional and relative, rather than an absolute, explanation.
But while the principle of relativity is now

governlnent. Furtllerlllore, the problerll of liberty is
only to a minol extellt a political prol:)lelll. And as it
is only to a lrlinor extent a politieal probleln, it can
llesler, ill atly true sense, lJe secllrecl by a mere repeal of
political laws, nor indeecl bl a mere ellactment of
political lal.N7s. Neither retnoval of politico-eeonoulic
restrictiolls upon freedom of trade, nor ellactment of
ulliv7ersal sllffrage, can give us rnore than a smal], fractiollal
part of liberty.

Our OaTu, familiar, everyday experience teaches t1S tllat
reStriCtiOIlS llpOIl our positive liberty of action are mainly
due to the coerciool of economic forees. T1lis coercion
of ecol-lomic forces lnalaifests itself in lllany ways, but
largely in ancl through colltract competitively formed.
Tllis is seen, -first of all, in wllat may be callecl the problessg
of the tzevessSieSA vn^z. Nineteen men wish to pursue
a certain course of ecollolnic aetioll, bllt are coerced
comptitively by tlle twentietll illtO a line of collduct
N71aicll tlley dislil e. Nilleteell barbers in the city of Madison,
WiSCOl]Sill, vislaed to close tlleir shops on Sunday;
tlle twelltietll woulcl llot agree to close lliS, alld consequently,
all tlge twenty were, and still are, kept open.
Nilaeteen men may desire to work ten hours a day, and
mal be coercecl by tlle twentieth into xrorlzing fourteen
hours a day. Apparelatly tlley are all working fourteen
hours a day becallse they clloose to do so, but tlle choice
is not a free one, in any true .Sense of tlle worcl. Even
the tarentietll ollan prefers to work ten llollrs a clay, but
yields to pressure for tlle sake of a ternporary aclvantage,
and so he is likewise coereed. The freedom -wizieh tllus
expresses itself in eontraet is in eertain eases lilSe the
freedotn of a slave, who chooses to work rather tllan to
suffer ullder the lash.

The coercion of ecolloznic forces is largely due to the

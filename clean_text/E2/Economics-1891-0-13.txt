all produce; and thus, in the end, the members of the
community would contribute, more or less perfectly,
according to their respective abilities.
AUl this is to define the Single Tax proposition, and
to set forth its true relations; not to discuss its economic
and political expediency, for which time would
be wanting here. While the familiar arguments on
this subject, pro and con, have been widely rehearsed
of late, I am not aware that anything of consequence
has been added thereto. Ten persons probably now
know what the Single Tax would be, and have their
opinions concerning it, where one knew or cared anything
about it a few years ago. But the extension of
the field of discussion has not altered the attitude of
the disputants. The advocates of the measure still
assert, in the same terms as of old, that the unearned
increment of land belongs to the State, and that it
should be used to diminish, or wholly to do away with,
the resort to other forms of contribution. The oppoinents
of the measure still assert their conviction that
the community, as a whole, is richer, and not poorer,
by reason of the private ownership of land; and that
the attempt to bring all of economic rent into the
public treasury would generate industrial evils and
would induce political jobbery and fraud to an appalling
extent
Meanwhile, if I may venture an opinion regarding
a matter of which no one man can know much, I
should say that the economists have rather been inclining
to the view that somewhat more of economic
rent than is now taken by the State might be brought
into the treasury, without impairing the virtue there
is in the private ownership of land, and without
directly violating the principle of compensation to existing

in the way of advantage in other directions, or something
which in itself brings an advantage? The essence
of the doctrine of free trade is that prima face
international trade brings a gain, and that restrictions
on it presumably bring a loss. Departure from this
principle, though by no means impossible of justification,
need to prove their case; and if made in view of the
pressure of opposing principles, they are matter for regret.
In this sense, the doctrine of free trade, however
widely rejected in the world of politics, holds its own
in the sphere of the intellect.

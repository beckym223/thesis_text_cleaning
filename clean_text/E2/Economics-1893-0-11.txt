whether this statement is exactly true; but it is beyond
question that that crop is sold over and over again, adding
enormously to the banking and clearing house transactions
of the city. By far the greater share of these
purchases and sales constitute no necessary part of the
process of getting the cotton from the planter to the
manufacturer. Speculators take advantage of this credit
organization, without which their operations would necessarily
be restricted within very narrow limits, to carry on
an enormous amount of gambling or betting on the future
price of cotton. It is not essential for our present purpose
to inquire whether this multiplication of purchases
and sales under speculative impulse is or is not detrimental
to production and to what we may call legitimate
trade; that is, those exchanges, be they few or be they
many, which are actually necessary to carry the product
most easily and surely from the farmer to the manufacturer.
I touch the subject here only to show how largely
this speculative trading, itself mainly the result of the
high organization of credit, contributes to inflate the statistics
of the bank and the clearing house, and thus to
produce the impression which has been adverted to, respecting
the relative insignificance of the use of money
in our day. What is true, in this respect, of cotton is
also true of corn, wheat, pork, petroleum, mining and
railroad stocks, and a hundred other subjects of exchange.
In this view, am I not justified inl saying that a very large
part of the credit transactions, the amount of which is so
freely adduced to show the comparative insignificance of
cash transactions, are, with respect to that object, purely
fictitious? Those who roll as sweet morsels under their
tongues such gigantic figures as thirty or forty thousand
millions a year, in speaking of the work of a single clearing
house, are really deceived if they think that these
sums represent either transactions that would have taken
place, did not the clearing-house mill stand ready to take

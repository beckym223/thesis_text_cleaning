and iteration. The industries of the country have become
habituated to it; and what is no less important,
public feeling has become habituated to it. As in Eng
land for a generation, free trade was the accepted doctrine
from the sheer force of use and habit, so in the
United States protection has been the accepted doctrine.
And, needless to say. just as continued material progress
strengthened the hold of the accepted system in England,
so it has strengthened the hold of the opposite
system in the United States. The appeal to let well
enough alone is always effective. The economic critic
may see in other directions abundant explanation of our
well-being, and may say that a country with such resources,
such institutions, and such a population would
have prospered under any commercial policy. But the
fact of prosperity tells powerfully in favor of the legislation
that in fact has been followed. It is not probable
that any substantial change of policy will be made until
this correspondence has been broken. When evil days
come, as sooner or later come they doubtless will, then
placid acquiescence in the existing order of things will
no longer bolster up the protective system, and the time
will be more propitious for a deliberate overhauling of
accepted notions and beliefs.

Thus, in conclusion, it may be said that the fundamental
principle of free trade has been little shaken by
all the discussion and all the untoward events of the
past half-century. But its application is not so easy
and simple as was thought by the economists of half-acentury
ago. A principle can be stated in clear-cut
terms, and an answer of yes or no can be given with
regard to it. The mode of its application, however,
raises questions of firo and con, and often involves a

stake of principle and to hold fast to the sheet anchor of
unprejudiced and undauntecl conclusion. The so-called
theorist has a heavy and often 1lndeserved load to bear.
The term is redolellt of condescension; it szzacks of contempt.
And yet, if the theory is what the word implies,
if it is a real exposition, a true statenzent of the necessary
relations between facts, thell no tnatter by what
method it has been reached, no matter how unlikely it
may seem or how unwelcome it may be, it rests 1lpon a
becl of adalnaIlt and will endure forever. To seek such
an explanation, to attain such a result needs not only
the most unremitting ardor, but often the most intrepid
resolution.

Tlle point, however, that it is desired to emphasize
here is tllat the facts of which an explanation is sought
must be chosen witll discrimillation. If the facts themselves
are really insignificant, the theory, no rnatter how
true, canllot fail to be trivial. The minor writers on
economics have, utlfortunately, far too often dissipated
their energies on such trivialities, and have, as a coIlsequence,
sunk to the depths of scholasticisln and mere
logomachy. If ecollomics is to be of ally real service, it
must deal with the importallt phenomena of economic
life. The great thinkers in our domain, however elevated
their view, however recondite their processes of
thought, have always stood on the firm foundatioll of
basic social relations. To whatever extent, for instance,
we may be tempted to disagree with the methods or the
conclusions of Ricardo, there is no doubt that the problems
which engaged his attention were entirely worthy
of so acute and so profound a mind. However abstract
the mode of treatment, however unfinished or fragmentary
the results, however remote the argllment from the
habitual and narrow considerations of the market place,

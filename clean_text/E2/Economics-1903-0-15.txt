The fourth characteristic of the modern age is the
development of the competitive regime. This needs
but little more than a mention. Several of the former
presidents of this Association have lllade you familiar
with the real meaning of cotnpetition. They have
pointed out that a competition of the right kind is a
necessity to social progress that progress consists not
in doing away with competition but in raising it to a
higher plane; not in suppressing it, but in preserving

rivalry. What often seems to be the crushing of
coznpetition is in reality the replacing of a lower by a
higher form. The trade-union movement, for instance,
with the progress from individual to collective bargaining,
seems frozn one point of view to lessen competition,
but no one who understallds the real philosophy of the
movement can doubt for a moment that on the whole it
makes for a truer and more perfect competitioll based
(n the equality of the contending forces. The trust
seems to be the very negation of competition, and yet if
the conditions of loyal and healthy enterprise are insisted
upon, and the trust be not permitted to take advantage
of a legal code lagglllg behind the economic
development, the llet results of the movemetlt may well
prove to be the sloughing off of the evils of a lower
competition and the attaintnent of a higher form of
emulation.

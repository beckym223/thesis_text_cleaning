foreigners arriving on our shores, and the not less
notable change in the character of the new comers,
seem to require that our people should seriously
debate the question whether their own social and
industrial well being and their duty to their posterity
do not demand the stringent restriction of
immigration by law.

I am not speaking now of measures for keeping
out a few thousands of "assisted immigrants,' or
for sending back some score of criminals and lunatics,
each year. The question I raise concerns, not
thousands, but millions. It is the question whether
there is to be any limit to the extent to which we
shall share our birthright, as a nation, with strangers.
The issue is a selfish one, clearly enough; but selfdefense
is a law of nature. The first duty of every
nation is to its own people and to their proper descendants.
It may not impair, or, beyond a certain

point imperil, those interests, for the benefit of others,
without bringing itself under scripture condemnation
as heathen and infidel.

But further, it may be said that the position of the
United States, viewed as a possible benefactor of the
race, is a highly peculiar one. So far as, after the
proper care and defense of our own people, we owe
any duty to other nations-and who shall say that we
do not?-that duty is best to be discharged by making
this experiment of free government and of educated
labor, here on this Western Continent, successful in
the very highest degree. Aside altogether from our
own interests, it may confidently be asserted that
nothing which we could do by offering homes, without
challenge, to some millions of the most wretched
of Europe, would add to the general sum of happiness

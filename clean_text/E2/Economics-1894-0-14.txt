the motives at work that the English income-tax law provides
for the taxation, not of total income, but of five
distinct classes of income, described under the schedules
A, B, C, D, and E. The schedules are broad, and cover
the ground fairly well, no doubt; but, if they do not, the
law does not concern itself with a failure on a small scale.
The great object is to narrow the field within nwhich individual
declarations must be relied on; and this is accomplished
by providing that under schedule A (rent), C
(public funds), and E (public offices), the tax shall be
collected at the source of the income, and not from the person
who enjoys it; that, under schedule B (farmers'
profits) the tax shall be assessed on an estinmated profit
equal to one-half of the rent paid; and that a declaration
shall be required only under schedule D for income
from trades and professions. In short, the source of the income
is aimed at by the English law\, wherever the nature
of the case permits; and the resort to declarations, recognized
as hazardous, is restricted to less than one-half of
the total actual assessmlent. This system is entirely at variance
with the current notion of an income tax; for under
it the income, as a whole, is not brought into view, and the
tax is laid, not on the income as such, but on several
probable chief constituents of the incomee. But, after all,
the practical question must be whether the tax is more
thoroughly collected under one system or the other. On
this point the remarkable regularity of receipts from the
English tax* and the close correspondence between es-

fore accepting the scheme of our single tax friends, because
their basis is too narrow, and the sacrifices demanded
from the present owners of land are too heavy.
Per contra, we need not accept the old project, now
again furbished up and presented by some, that the ideal
impost is a tax on all forms of productive capital,-for
quite irrespective of its magnificent impracticability, the
theory of capitalization renders it quite unnecessary.
Our American system is therefore moving in the right
direction. We do not levy our so-called indirect taxes
indiscriminately as of old; but apart from the tariff, the
importance of which is only secondarily fiscal, we limit
the subject of federal taxation to a very few articles of
widespread consumption. We no longer in our most advanced
states attempt in practice to levy a general property
tax, but are content, as is almost true in New York
to-day, with state taxes levied not on individuals, but on
inheritances and corporations. Finally, while in local
taxation we still hold to the theory of a general property
taxnin practice we are fast coming to the well nigh
exclusive taxation of real estate.
But whereas we are moving in the right direction in
these commonwealths where the conditions are ripe,
simply because the economic facts are too strong for the
law, the law still conforms to the old theory. And the
difficulty of altering the law is ascribable to the fact
that neither our statesmen nor our economists have yet
been able to frame a theory which will at once explain
the conditions and respond to the sense of justice in the
popular mind. Let us hope that when once we shall
have realized the true implications of this newer theory
which emphasizes the social aspects of economic law, we
shall be able to prove to the satisfaction of all that in
order to secure justice we do not need to impose a tax
which seeks equally to hit in first instance every indi-

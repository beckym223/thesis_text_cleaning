interest. It still remains to be seen, as to this
larger discussion, just what the outcome will be in the
reconstruction of economic teaching as a whole; but it
is clear that, so far as the doctrine of free trade is concerned,
enthusiasm has been supplanted by cautious
weighing or open doubt. Half a century ago those
Germ~an and French writers who -advocated free trade
were certain that the future was theirs: protection was
the waning doctrine, and its advocates were hopelessly
reactionary. At present, certainly in Germany and
more or less in other countries, a large school has just
the opposite feeling. Free trade would seem to be the
waning doctrine. Laissez-faire and freedom have had
their day, and the future belongs to the conscious direction
of industry at the hands of the state. International
free trade has no more sanctity or authority than any
other part of the obsolete system of natural liberty, and
the advantages or disadvantages of tariff restrictions are
to be coolly weighed for each country by itself, in the
light of specific experience.

In view of this unmistakable change in the general
attitude, even the most convinced free-trader must feel
called on to reconsider the question, and weigh once
more the arguments for protection. Some such task I
propose for myself to-night: not indeed the formidable
one of going over the entire subject afresh, but that of
passing in review some of the argDuments most commonly
heard, and more especially those of which most is
heard in our own country.

First of all, something may be said as to those aspects
of the controversy of which most is heard in popular
discussion in this country. Here, as it happens, the situation
is comparatively simple; for there is perhaps a
nearer approach to a consensus of opinion on current

I898, when it opened a College of Commerce and Politics.
The University of California began similar work in its
College of Commerce in August, and the University of
Ohio ir] September of the same year. ColulnbiaUlliversity
worked out a plan for a four-years' college
course in the year I899, which will be put into work-
-ing operatiotl as S0011 as funds can be obtained. In
tlle year I 9V0 tlle following institlltions inaugurated
the work: Dartluouth College, in the Alnos Tuck
School of Adluinistration and Fi nallce; the University
of Verlllont, in its Departlnent of Comlllerce
and Econolnics; New York University, ill its School
of Commerce, Accounts and Finance; the University
of AIiciligan, in its Special Courses in Higher
Colnmercial Eclucation ancl Public Adlllinistration; and
the University of Wisconsin, in its Scllool of Cozzlmerce.l
Tlle University of Illinois has requested the legislature
for an anl-lllal appropriation of $I7,500 to defray tlle expenses
of such a department, allcl it is announced that
the University of Iowa will make a similar request.
Now what is tlle real force underlying this movement
and what is tlle cause of this sucldell, and to many people,
unexpectecl acceleration within the last three years ?
Vii=hat ground is there to sllppose that this progress is to
continue in tl-le future ?
Tlle explanation of this remarkable advance is found,
-in nly opinion, ill two circumstances-a growing recognition
on the part of our colleges that there is a wide
and unexploited field open to them, whicll it is their
duty to occupy alld cultivate, ancl at the same tinle a
growing demand for higher educatioll in our busilless
classes themselves ancl a conseqllent turning of their attention
toward the existing centers of higller edtlcation

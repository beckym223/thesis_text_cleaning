It may appear at first sight that the act of 1894 makes
some concession to the method of taxation at the source,
by the provision that all corporations doing business for a
profit, including banks, insurance, railway, and telegraph
companies, shall pay a tax of 2 per cent. on their annual
net profits; and that dividends thus taxed at the source
shall not be included in the taxable income of the stockholder.
Whether this provision was adopted for any other
reason than the increased facility of collection, especially
from non-residents, and the occasion which it supplies for
requiring from all corporations a statement of accounts,
may well be doubted. At all events, the provision acts,
for the most part, not as a substitute for the declaration,
but as an auxiliary; for the tax-payer, except in cases
where his income from other sources than dividends is not
more than $3,500, must still make his declaration in due
form. It is clear, then, that the act does not tax this
species of income at its source as the means of exempting
any considerable number of persons from the duty of making
the usual declaration. Apparently, in the mind of the
legislator, the collection of a tax at its source and the declaration
by the tax-payer are things altogether dissociated.
In some other particulars, also, the treatment of the
question of paymient by corporations in the new act is
hard of explanation. It would seem, for example, that
there would be the same reasons of convenience and security
for collecting from corporations the tax on their payments
of interest, as for collecting from them the tax on
dividends. The former income-tax law, which cared little
about the question of method, but cared much for speedy,
certain, and large collections, provided that the income tax
upon interest or coupons should be detained by all corporations,
as well as the tax on dividends or other profits,
and should be paid over in like manner to the United
States.* This was a most judicious and useful provision,

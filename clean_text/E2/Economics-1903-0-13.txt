quences. Agricultural capital and commercial capital
have been responsible for the landed and trading aristocracies
of the past; industrial capital correctly
analyzed and rightly colstrolled means not industrial
aristocracy, but industrial democracy.
Thirdly, and intimately connected with what had just
been said, is tlle modern application of scientific methods
to industry. We speak glibly of the recent progress of
science, but few realize the true import of this growing
subjection of nature to man, and of the revolutionary
character of this harnessing of the powers of the universe
to the yoke of the human intellect. For one thing it has
made possible an almost limit]ess increase ill production.
Landed capital, under the non-scientific methods of the
past, was able to go so far and no farther. Even when
extensive methods of agriculture were replacecl by the
intensive systems, the operation of the law of diminishing
returns SOOll made itself felt, and marked a limit
beyond which aclvance was impossible. The advent of
coznmercial capital indeed increased prosperity, and to
the extent that exchange is really a phase of production
augmented the productive power of the world. But here
again its efficiency was limited within narrow bounds.
Creating new values simply by the bartering of existing
values, the pyramid of wealth rested on the basis of the
actual production within each cotnmunity, and could not
be piled up beyond a certain height. But with modern
industrial capital and the snatching from nature of her
intimate secrets, the utilization of natural resources
within each country has become almost boundless, and
provides an ever broadening base for the benefits of trade
and commerce.
It is for this reason that the history of the world in
the future is to be so different from the past. In former

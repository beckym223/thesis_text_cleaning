whatever be the source of that demand, whether an
instinctive appetency for a certain metal, or the
force of law conferring legal-tender power upon bits
of colored paper; whatever be the causes which control
that supply, whether mere convention or absolute

Again, the money supply is not a matter of no consequence.
Alike considerable excess and considerable
deficiency inevitably become the source of direful
ills and woes unnumbered. If of an irredeemable
and fluctuating paper currency, that alcohol of commerce,

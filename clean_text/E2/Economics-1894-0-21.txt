ence with the actual ability of the tax-payer. It then becomes
possible to provide, in some cases, for an increase
of the tax where new sources of income are opened to the
tax-payer within the year, and in some to lighten the tax
where misfortune has diminiished his income since the assessment
for the year was mnade.* The tax then loses
some of its harshness, and something of its present aspect
of an arbitrary levy, and takes its place as a natural and
speedy result of the good or bad fortune of the year in
which it is due.
It is not worth while, however, to go farther in urging
this or that point in which the method of levying an income
tax in this country is defective. The law of 1894
marks no advance in this difficult branch of taxation.
The whole subject is one in regard to which our legislators,
national and local, are bound in a singular degree by
habit and precedent. A practice once adopted becomes
fixed, an old method is good and a new one is visionary,
and the appeal to the experience of other countries is pronounced
un-American. The fr'amers of the new law have
made no exceptional mistake in resolutely shutting their
eyes to what may be learned elsewhere on this subject.
They have taken the course which might easily have been
predicted, in going to the legislation of the Civil War t for
the model to be followed at the present time; but they
have followed that model without thought or discrimination,
and without the defence of overwhelming necessity
which could be made for their predecessors thirty years
ago.

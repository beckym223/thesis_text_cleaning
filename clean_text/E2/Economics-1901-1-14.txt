future lawyer, physieiall or engineer. Ill other words,
I believe it sholllcl reeogllize it as one of its ploper alld
neeessary funetions to provide the best faeilities of whieh
it is eapable for tllis trailling, aIlcl I aIn happy to say,
that in l-ny OpilliOIl tlle qlleStiOn iS no longer whether
the Al-lleriean uIliversity shall take this attitude, but
simply lloev it ean reeognize this ftlnetion allcl earry it

The qllestion as to wl-lat sllolllci be tlle fundamental
elemellt in the higller edueation and traiIlillg of the futtlre
bllsiness mall, is to l-lle eolllparatively silnple. It sllould
be those branelles of seienee wlliell deal witll tlle departllleIlts
of liNe to whiell btlsiness belongs. BusiIless
is, of eollrse, a soeial aIld eeonomie phenomenon, allcl
to sotne extetlt, a politieal one, aIld eollsequently tlle
stucly of tlle politieal and soeial seienees, using that

diseussion of the partielllar brallelles whieh ollght

politieal allcl soeial seiellees, it seelns to me that eeonomies
should be aeeeptecl as the fllnclallleIltal elemellt
in an7 sllell eourse. It is just at tllis point that the interest
of this assoeiation is tBost intilllately involvecl.
The seiellee of politieal eeonomy llas tlle sallle relatiorl
toward this wllole department of edueation, as mathenlatllies
to tlle preparatioll of all engiIleer, or as pllysiology
or anatouly to lneclieal trainin>. It has, moreover,
the aclded advatltage of beiIlg the most llighly cleveloped
of all tllese subjeets, tlleoretieally or praetieally, botl-l as
a lnatter of seienee anci as a Inatter of pedagogy. The
mall nvho grapples in earnest with problems of eeonotnies
will seeure, if notlling else, a tnental diseiplille

clearing house cut a very small and sorry figure, indeed, in
comparison with the spectacle which has been afforded
of a great nation on the verge of general insolvency, thousands
of factories and workshops closed, hundreds of thousands
of workmen thrown out of employment, all because
a certain amount of cash, of actual money, had been
locked up in strong boxes and bank vaults. When one
considers what this great industrial nation has passed
through within the last sixty days because a portion only
of its money had been withdrawn, he is fairly in a position
to appreciate the senselessness of all this talk about the
unimportance of the money supply which I took for my
theme on this occasion. Until we have forgotten how we
saw the banks of the commercial and financial metropolis
refuse to pay their balances to other cities in cash on demand;
how we saw great and rich firms paying their
workmen in checks of $2, $3, and $5, and these checks
not payable at the bank, but stamped "payable only at
the clearing house"; until we have forgotten how we saw
great factories carrying on their business timidly from day
to day, not with money and not with proper commercial
credit, but upon the frail foundation of sympathy and forbearance
from their creditors and even from their operatives,
while thousands of other manufacturers refused to
carry on business at all under such conditions, and closed
their works,- until we forget these universal experiences
of the past few weeks, we shall, I think, be disposed to
give Sir John Lubbock's bank a rest. No more striking
demonstration could possibly have been given of the fact
that, after all credit canl do, money, actual money, money
that passes from hand to hand, is still the vital blood of
commerce, than has been afforded by the crisis through
which the United States has just passed. For weeks the
nation walked along the very verge of a precipice, under
a strain which could not possibly have continued for as
many weeks longer without hurling industry and trade to

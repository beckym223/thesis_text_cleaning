tion and the fruition of those latent qualities and possibilities
that distinguish us from the brutes and that constitute
our personality. Moral development means selfdevelopment,
and progress can come only through freedom.
Individualism in this sense is the very goal of all
achievement.
We must, however, not forget that the individual has
become what he is largely through society. Let us remember
that side by side with the individual struggle
for existence, there has been the group struggle and
that, as has recently been pointed out, the mutual aid
within the group has been the very condition of the contest
between the groups. Let us remember that the individual
as he exists to-day has been hammered out by
society, that individual ethics is the result of social
ethics, and that individual progress is largely the consequence
of social progress.
Economics, politics and ethics are each of them a part
of the greater social science. In each of them we find
the universal problem of attaining unity in multiplicity.
The aim of economics is to show the reconciliation of
private wealth with public welfare; the object of politics
is to secure individual liberty through a free commonwealth;
the goal of ethics is to prove that individual
morality is in harmony with the very conception of the
universe. Economics shows how a prosperous individual
can come only through a prosperous society;
politics teaches how a free individual can persist only
in a free society; and ethics makes it clear how a perfect
individual can be conceived only as a constituent of
a perfect society. Prosperity, freedom, morality-all
alike are at bottom social conceptions. They can be
reached in practice only through a common striving
together; they can be comprehended in theory only
through an analysis which accentuates the social
element.

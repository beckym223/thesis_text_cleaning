Afriea alad in the tropieal islands of Asia that tlle COIlditions
are still favorable to slavery. Were they to
form so eontrolliIlg a part of the elupire as in former
clays in the eolollies of Greeee ancl Rome, the present
struggle in Ellglandn Hollancl, Germany, alad the UIlited
States to solve tlle labor probletn in the clepelldeneieWs
without reeol1rse to eolnpulsion would be far less likely
of aeeomplishmellt. It is beeause the entirely diGerent
eeolaomie systerns ancl eonsequent soeial ethies of the
mother eountries are now the potent faetors in the world
tllat we ean eollfidently look -forward to the speedy passing
of slavery in eve1-y part of the globe. Morality, indeed,
is cloing its noble work, but at bottoIll lies the
disappearanee of free land.

Seeonclly, the predominanee of industrial eapital.
Sotne thinkers, from Phaleas of old to the Henry George
and Loria of to-day, aseribe all ot1r soeial troubles to
landed eollditions. Others, like Demolills in Franee alad
Brooks Aclams at hotlle, tell llS that the eomlnereial
route is the seeret of prosperity and deeadellee. Tllere
is a eertain degree of trutll ill eaeh of these eontentiolls
as an exp]anation of the past. Both elasses of thinkers,
however, fail to reeognize the essential ellanges brought
about byT 1lloderll industrialism. The eonditions of landholding
undoubtedly played a dominant role in Ronze,
as they did in feudal Europe alld eolonial Ameriea.
The eontrol of the trade routes was assuredly the ehief
faetor in the rise and fall of the oriental tnonarehies, of
the Greek eity states, of the Italiala and Gerlnan towns,
of Portugal and Spain. But why is this? Clearly beeause
of the absellee of indllstrial eapital. In the one
ease the eeol1omie system was based on the aseendelley
of land as a faetor ill productioll; in the other ease on
the equal or even superior foree of eomlnercial eapital.

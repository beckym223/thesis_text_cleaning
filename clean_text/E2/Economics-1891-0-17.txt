any consideration to the possible mischief to be
wrought by contraction, even if they did not expressly
hold with Mr. Wells, that ",a three-cent piece,
if it could be divided into a sufficient number of

less acre of land cultivated, yard of cloth made, toll
of coal dug or pound of iruin smelted, in consequence."

to be attached to this ministerial manifesto in the politics
of a great nation, must we not recognize the important
consequences of such an error in theory.
I do not wish to be understood as intimating that because
one of the premises happens to be unfortunately
chosen, the conclusion cannot be defended on other
grounds. On the contrary, the relation between the individual
and the social elements of economics has often
been inadequately expounded by the free traders, no less
than by the protectionists. Adam Smith himself seems
to realize that the collective interests are paramount,
when he seeks to unfold the principles of the Wealth of
Nations, but he identifies the social with the individual
interests when subject to the unimpeded action of natural
law. The Mercantilists of old based their demands
for extreme protection on the mistaken theory of balance
of trade-mistaken, because it confused the collective
economy with the private economny-because it assumed
that a country, like an individual, must have a surplus
money income. But the Free Traders went to anl opposite
extreme when they identified the social with the
individual interest and claimed that if only individual
action be unfettered and if free scope be given to the
principle of self-interest the results are bound to be beneficent
for the group as well.

Another illustration of the tangle of thought into
which we are plunged by the failure to realize the social
implication of economic law is to be found in the theory
of private property. We have been taught that our
modern age is immeasurably superior to that of classic
antiquity, and as a typical proof we are referred to the
progress in the theory of property. The Roman doctrine
of private property was that of occupation, and is
no doubt to be explained in large measure by the facts

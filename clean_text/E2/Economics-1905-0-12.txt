source of loss to the dumped country; unless, indeed we
throw over all our accepted reasoning on international
trade and take the crude protectionist view in to/o. If
one country chooses to present goods to another for less
than cost; or lets its industrial organization get into
such condition that a monopoly can levy tribute at
home,,-and is then enabled, or compelled by its own interests,
to present foreign consumers with goods for less
than cost,-why should the second country object? Is
not the consequence precisely the same, so far as that
other country is concerned, as if the cost of the goods
had been lowered by improvements in production or
transportation, or by any method whatever? Unless
there is something harmful per se in cheap supply from
foreign parts, why is this kind of cheap supply to be
condemned ?
The answer to this question seems to me to depend
on the qualification stated above-if this sort of thing
goes on indefinitely. Suppose it goes on for a considerable
time, and yet is sure to cease sooner or later.
There would then be a displacement of industry in the
dumped country, with its inevitable difficulties for labor
and capital; yet later, when the abnormal conditions
ceased, a return of labor and capital to their former
occupations, again with all the difficulties of transition.
It is the temporary character of dumping that gives
valid ground for trying to check it.
A striking case of this sort has always seemed to me
to be that of the European export bounties on sugar,
which for so long a period caused continental sugar to
be dumped in Great Britain. These bounties were not
established of set purpose. They grew unexpectedly,
in the leading countries, out of a clumsy system of internal
taxation. They imposed heavy burdens on the

who looks below tlle surface ill the study of these two
institutions, will be brought to conclusiolls directly opposite
from tllose which prevail in so lullell of the current
thought of the world to-day.
Does the theory of competition ,ive ground for the
view that a struggle between different parts for their
class interests, works out in an econzo1nic hartnony?
Not at all. It shows, on the contra1-y, that strugg-les
ZeviShiv each class, antagonistic for the moment to the
appare11t interests of tllat class, so conduce to the interests
of tnany other parts of the body politic as to work
GUt a generally beneficent result. No econelllist of any
reputatiol1 would hold for a IllotTlent that the econonoic
struggles of differel1t men for themselves, wol11d furnish
a reasonable basis of adjllstlnent, or conaproollise, with
those in diGerent pOSitiOllS. What the chanopioll of
coznpetition holds, is rather tl-lat the struggles of each
mall for llilll.self prevent others, wlao are ill a sionilar
position, frolll takiolg undtze advantage over their fellow
nen. It is not a COllfliCt between classes, but a conflict
withill classes, wlaicll he seeks to perpetuate; aold he
woulcl perpetuate it because he can prove, or tllinks
that he can prove, that it conduces to a comlllol1 interest
more wide and lllore lasting thall those which the individual
classes, if organi%ecl into trusts or trades llniotls,
would seek to pursl1e.
It is popularly said that coznpetitiol1 is only the form
wlaich the struggle for existence takes in nzodern civili
7ed societZ. Tllis is at once true and false true in
form, false in the suggestions to which it gives rise.
The fact is, that tnodern civilized comlnunities have so
regulated the struggles for existence, tllat tl1ey tend, on
the whole, to the benefit of third parties, rat11er than to
their detriment. Two cats stmggle to eat the same

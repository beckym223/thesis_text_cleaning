level for all forms that succeed in surviving. This is
lnade clear by the fact that wherever competition- is
wholly removed, as through the agency of man, in the
interest of any one form, that fortn itnmediately begins
to make great strides and soon outstrips all those that
depelld UpO11 cornpetition. Such has been the case
with all tlle cereals and fruit trees; it is the case with
domestic cattle and sheep, with horses, dogs, and all the
forms of life tllat lzlan has excepted from the biologic
law alld subjected to the law of lllind, aold both tlle agricultural
and the pastoral stages of society rest upon the
successful resistance which rational man llas offered to
the law of nature in these departments. So that we
have now to add to the waste of competition its influence
in preventing the really fittest frotn surviving." '
While in general re tnust agree with Professor NAlardj
I do not tllink that the process which he describes is to
be called the suppression of competition, but rather a
regulation of competition by the milld of man. It
means the establishment of the environment alld the
selection of the plants and anitnals for survival on the
pre-arranged environment.
If the foregoing collsiderations are possessed of validity,
we can readily see one of the tests to which we must
submit proposed measures of social amelioration. A
good social measure NlUSt strengthen the individual and
the group for competition. On the other hatld, the test
of a bad colldition is that it weakens individuals and
groups, in the competitive struggle. Iwet me offer a single
illustration.

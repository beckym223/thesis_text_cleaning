by the growth of popular education and the extension

explaining the very remarkable spread of the ideas
known as Nationalist. This may or may not commend
itself to your minds. It is that the phenomenon
is largely the result of a reaction from the nervous
strain and the continuous excitement under
which the cultivated classes in a modern community,

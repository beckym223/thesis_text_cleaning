of tllem as never before.

There is, llloreover, a growing belief in the effieaey
of professional ecltleation ancl speeial trainillg as a
valuable or indispensable elen-zent in the preparation of
the yollllg lllan for l-lis ftlture ealling. A eentllry ago
almost nolDocly ill tl-lis COlllltl-y tilougllt of tlle 1leeessity
of sellool trainillg for any calling or profession. Tl-le
lawyer, pllyrsieian, elergylllall, engilleer, farlller, teaeher,
sougllt his preparation, not in sonce tecllllieal scllool,
but ill tlle offiee, tlle stucly, tlle store, tlle shop, the field.
To-clay tlle vietory of the srell-plallned currieululn over
tlle llapha%ard training of tlle sllop, tlle faetory, the
offiee, the store or the farlll, is well assurecl, and it is
otlly a question of time wllell tlle same thing will be
true of l-nerean tile ancl eolllmereial life also. l
Sueh is a lDrieE descriptiotl of the present eondition of
the question as to what is the relation of tlle eollege and
university to lligller eommereial trainillg. It is also an
explanation, and to a eertain exteIlt, a justifieation, of
tlle developlllent wllieh llas thus far takell plaee. All
exalnination of wllat llas takell plaee up to tlle present
allcl a searcll illtO the eallses llnclerlyillg- tiliS development,
seenlecl to llle, on tlle wllole, to lDe the llloSt satisfactory
wa of settillg forth my views upon tllis stlbjeet,
ancl I Inay I1OW proeeecl to formlllate Irly icleas in a little
more deEnite way, as to the presellt and future poliey,
ancl submit tlle result to your eonsideration.
I beliexe tlle Auleriean university ougllt to take tlle
same attitucle toward tlle higher trainillg of the future
merehant, railway or insuranee manager, as it has so

commenting on the remark of Professor Bonamy Price,
that the vast operations of modern commerce only reproduce
the simplest acts of primitive barter, I ventured to
use the following image :
The savage builds his canoe of materials every part of which
would float of itself. The civilized man builds his broadside shipof-
war of material which of itself would drop like a plummet to
the bottom. We may find, in our farther investigation, that there is
something more in the philosophy of money than comes out in the
primitive trade between the tailor, the butcher, and the baker.
But, in fact, does anything in the transition from a primitive
to a highly organized trade impair the validity of
the proposition that the value of money (whatever that
money may, in the place and at the time, consist of) depends,
like the value of anything else, on the relations of
demand and supply; that prices are determined in the
amount of goods offered for money, and the amount of
money offered for goods ? This is the question I presume
to raise to-day.
It is enough to make the most faithful soul flinch and
shrink, to be asked to go back to the contemplation of a
primitive community and to consider the origin of money;
yet in this case it seems to be necessary, and I will try not
to be tedious. Let us suppose that in such a community,
the members of which pursue various occupations and produce
different kinds of commodities, the difficulties of direct
exchange are so great as to put a heavy penalty upon
barter, or, to express it otherwise, to place a high premium
upon the use of money; and that, by consequence, all
commodities are exchanged through the intervention of
moiley. It was with reference to such a supposed situation
that the proposition which has been more than once
repeated in this paper was framed. In such a case, we
should all agree that the value of money depended on
the demand for and supply of money. In speaking of the
demand for money, we should of course understand that

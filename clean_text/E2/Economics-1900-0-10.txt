bird; two bosses conzpete to eluploy the sallle workman.
Frotll the standpoillt of tlle bosses, the trallsaction bears
sollle analogy to the case of the cats. From the stand
point of the workman, the tlansaction bears no analogy
whatever to the case of tlle bircl. Tlle more cats tllere
are, the worse for the bircl, as well a.s for tlle cats; the luore
bosses there are, the worse for the bosses, but the better
for the workman. Whell Adam Smith showed the
efficiency of competition as a reglllator of price and an
itlerease of useful production, he furnished a powerful
defence for tlle existing social ordel-. He cannot, how
ever, for that reasoll, !e fail-ly charged with having been
an advocate of tlle interests of the property owller. Tlae
weight allcl force of llis reasoning lay ill the fact tllat lle
sllowed the beneficent effects of such coolopetition upon
the colntnullity as a wllole, rather than oll persons most
ilumecliately interested. He may have exaggerated
those good effects alld underratecl tlle evils by which
they were accolllpanied. I sllall not llOW try to discuss
that pOillt. But his perlnanent and decisive illfluellce
as a social reformer lay not i.l an advocacy of the views
of any class, but ill his advocacy of a means of correctilag
the forlllation of class lines. The success of cotnpetition,
so far from warranting llS ill the adoptioll of a
system of political Illorality alld a theory of political
progress, based on aclvocacy of class ilzterests. pronres
ratller the advantage alld even the llecessit) of subordiating
those interests to a wider common good.
With the institution of representative governlllent the
case is soznewhat clifferellt. Here we hasTe an organization
of localities alld of classes, and a recogllition of such
clas.ses in the actual work of government. It would,
therefore, seeril as though the success of tllis system
were a powerful argulnent on the side of that theory

are beginning to see that the securest guarantee of liberty
is the social sanction-that true and permanent freedom
is at bottom all outgrowth of social forces, and that
individual bargaining results in a mere empty husk of

must be so devised as not to close the door of opportunity
to either the unfortunate or the peculiarly gifted.
To magnify the individual at the expense of the social

elaborated modern liberty and modern democracy, not
in the backwoods of a frontier community but in the
busy marts of commerce and the complex home of industry.


But however tempting the pursuit of this line of inquiry
would be, I must pass it by in order to reach what
is in some respects a still more important illustration.
This is to be found in the domain of public finance.
Partly for this reason, and partly because the questions
of public finance have never been touched upon by any

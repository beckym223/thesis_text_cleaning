Ricardo implicitly; in his theory of prosperity he
differed from hiln at every point. It was just because
he accepted so thorougllly olae part of tlle Ricardian
economics that lle was able to dissellt so collsistently
from the other, with a directness of opposition borll of
mutual understandioag. It was because each assutned so
fully t}<e existence of free cotupetition, and carried out
that assumption so completely to certain of its logical
collsequelaces, that this same power became a demigod
to the olle and a demon to the other. In tlle words of
the poet,
" Both read the same books, day and llight,
But thou readest black where I read white."
As far as a man's political economy takes the fortn of
a theory of distribution, it is not sure to be very closely
collnected with his ethical principles, or even with llis
political ones. In framing such a theory he is occupied
with tracing consequences from observed facts. His
political antecedents or his ethical prepossessiolls may
lead him to observe some facts more closely than others,
or to examille some parts of his chain of reasoning more
critically thala other parts. But these variations, as
far as they exist, are errors, even from the man's own
standpoillt, errors which he is interested in correcting
as soon as they can be brought clearly home to him.
He can say, in tlle words of Dunoyer, is Je ntisspose rien}
ye sse propose Wseme rien . jexpose ) I am lleither impounder
llor evetl propounder, but expounder. Nor do
his theories of distribution modify his ethics onuch more
than his ethics ulodify his theories of distribution; except,
perhaps, so far as the halDitual assumption of a set
of facts and laws leads to tlle habitual assuluption of the
rightness of those laws, morally as well as intellectually.

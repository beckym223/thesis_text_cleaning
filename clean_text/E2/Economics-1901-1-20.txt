thus opened for the school, though the two-year curriculum, which
was open to students upon the coulpletion of the first two years in
co]lege, was retailled.

01Vhen Albert S. Bolles accepted a pOSitiOll in the State govertllalellt
at Harrisburg, Edlllund J. Jatnes was entrusted xvith the practical admillistration
of the school, and later ap?ointed Director. For admisSiOll
to the cul-ricllluin, noser lellgthelled from two to four years, ssrere
demanded in general the same requisites as for the classical or technical
colleges. Many new cotlrses +rere added, with a result of
strellgthenillg alld establis'ning the department lnore firmiy. Instrlletors
rvere appointed ill the theory and practice of accounting,
trallsportation, banking, jollrnalisln, and other pl-actical subjects,
besides additional instructors in economics and politics. The fouryear
plan thus adopted by the NVhartoll School ilas lgeell accepted, as
indicated in the text, by most of OU1' institutiolls whicl-l have undertaken
this xvork. As all evidence of the deilland for this kind of instrtletion,
the fact may lDe stated, that while the \Alhartoll School
course is oIle of a large nulllber of elective courses offered in the IJniversity
of Penllsylvallia, it has a greater attenclance thall the average
of the courses. The follonvillg table shows the attelldance fronl r895

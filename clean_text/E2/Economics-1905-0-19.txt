economic theory, and is to be considered chiefly in the
light of specific experience. The benefits of imports
and exports, the relations of domestic and foreign industry,
wages, foreign cheap labor, surplus products,
over-production, dumping,-these topics at once spread
over into the general field of economics. Not only do
theyThus enlarge, but they can be disposed of chiefly
by that mode of general reasoning from comparatively
simple premises which still remain the most valuable
tool at the disposal of the economist. But whether
protection to young industries will or will not have
good effects, is simply a question of probability for the
given case. Precisely the opposite result from protection
has not infrequently been discovered or supposed
to be discovered. It has been said that, so far from
leading to improvements and eventual cheapening, it
leads to the retention of antiquated and inefficient
wages of production and so to continued enhancement
of prices. There is good ground for believing that the
long continued protective regime in France during the
first half of the nineteenth century had ill results of
this kind. One of our ardent free-traders, the late
David A. Wells, repeatedly maintained that the same
consequences had appeared in the United States. His
conclusion may have been justified by what happened
during the period of abnormal industrial conditions
that followed the Civil War; yet I doubt whether the
experience of the United States as a whole supports it.
The truth is that either result may ensue. Among
an active and enterprising people the diversion of industry
into new channels may lead to progress, improvement,
and eventual gain; whereas in a timid and
stagnant people the stimulus of competition from
abroad may be necessary to rouse them, to their best efforts.

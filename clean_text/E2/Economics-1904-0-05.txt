When we say, correctly enough, that value' is the expression
of utility, we really mean that it is the expression
of social marginal utility. While social utility indeed
is made up of a combination of individual utilities
-that is, while a thing cannot be useful to society unless
it is useful to the individuals who compose the social
group, the marginal utility that controls value is the reflection
of the social marginal utility. Even though a
pound of iron may at a given moment conceivably be
of more direct use to an individual than a pound of diamonds,
a pound of iron does not satisfy as mnany, or as
urgent, social wants as a pound of diamonds. Iron is
less valuable than diamonds because its social mnaroginal
utility is less. In the saine way, when we say that value
depends on cost, we refer really to social, not to individual,
cost. The street sweeper inay work harder than an
opera singer, yet the value of his services will be less.
It miay cost me five days to make a table that the factory
will turn out in five hours, yet my table will not
sell for more. The marginal cost around which values
gravitate is not individual cost, but social cost. The
value of a commodity is due not to the labor of the individual
who has made it, but to the social service which
it is going to render, that is, to the social sacrifice which
it is going to save. When we say that individual cost
of production fixes value, we really mean that it expresses
the value that is fixed by social forces as a whole.
The failure to recognize the essential equivalence of
marginal utility and marginal cost is due to the neglect
of this social element. It is true indeed that in modern
life there is no such equivalence for the individual considered
as such; and this has led most thinkers astray.

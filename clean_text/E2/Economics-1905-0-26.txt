motives, the undying love of distinction, in the direc-
tion of economic initiative and varied development.
Factors of the same kind have been powerful in our
own country. Every career and every degree of success
have been open to all; and open not only under the law,
but under the mobile conditions of a thoroughly demo-
cratic community. The most obvious avenue to dis-
tinction has been the attainment of wealth; a state of
things by no means of unmixed advantage, but with un-
mistakable effect on industrial progress. Large enter-
prises, whether in trade, manufactures, or transportation,
have long enlisted the most capable intellects of the
country. Every opportunity for the conduct of busi-
ness on a large scale has been eagerly scanned with keen
eyes by the captains of industry. Add to this, the early
development of a high degree of mechanical skill and
ingenuity, and natural resources which are varied and
abundant to an unusual degree, and you have condi-
tions under which legislative stimulus is at best of sec-
ondary importance. The evidence seems to me conclu-
sive that the United States, under any tariff system,
would have become a country with varied industries and
with highly developed manufactures. The protective
duties have only affected the degree and the direction of
that development.
Still another factor deserves to be noted. Not only

nity has its effect, but that spirit with reference to other
communities also. The political position of a country
and its martial success seem to have a reflex effect on
the industrial success of its citizens in time of peace.
Here the recent development of Germany is apposite.
Her industrial advance during the last thirty years is
one of the striking phenomena of our time, and leads

in passing, that it may be doubted whether the
same danger of doing violence to an instinctive sense of
the difference between income and capital is not met in
any attempt to make an income tax widely inclusive by
sweeping phrases. " Gains, profits, or income ... derived
from any kind of property, rents, interest, dividends, or
salaries, or from any profession, trade, employment, or
vocation,... or from any other sources whatever,"- is
it possible, under such a description of the object of taxation
as this, to keep to any such line as that which the
Prussian law, cited above, so clearly points out? In this
case the legislator of 1894, like his predecessor of 1864,
in his overweening anxiety lest some taxable persons
should escape, runs to the opposite extreme of throwing
his net over a greater number whom the law should properly
let alone. But this excess of zeal is not peculiar to
income-tax laws or to our national legislation.
Coming now to the method by which the amount of
taxable income, however described, is to be ascertained
and brought to the knowledge of the assessing officer, we
find that the act of 1894 follows the line laid down by the
acts passed during the Civil War, by making the personal
declaration of the tax-payer the basis on which the collector
is to proceed, with the aid of the best information
he can obtain. Nothing could be simpler, on paper, than
this method. The tax-payer is himself the one person
who kniows best the amount of his income for the tax
year, and knows best the elements from which it may be
computed if its amount is doubtful. The law imposes
upon him the duty of making the necessary disclosure for
confidential use by the public officer; and under a free
government it is presumed that the great mass of citizens
can be trusted to perform what is, after all, in a sense a
self-imposed duty. But what has been the experience of
the several States in assessing by the same method the

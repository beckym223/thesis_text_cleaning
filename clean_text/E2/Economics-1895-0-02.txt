mlinus the cost of materials, measures the productive
power of labor apart from capital.

More than the value created by making" a hundred
yards of cloth the employer cannot pay to the new men
as wages; if he pays more he incurs a loss. As much
as this he is obliged to pay if competition exists.,
All through the industrial field tests are going on that
show how large the product is that can be attributed to
labor only. Wages tend to conform to that product..
They are fixed by the specific productivity of social
labor.

Is there, at present, enough of competition to ensure
this result ? Wages are adjusted largely by strikes,
actual or potential. Does a test of endurance between
employer and employed appeal ill any way to the pro-.
ductivity of social labor as a standard of wages? Yes,
because, if men demand much more than this, they cannot
get it. Their places will be filled by men taken
from other points in the field. If they demand less,
they get what they claim. A strike directly appeals to
the natural standard of wages.

A monopoly aims to reduce its output of goods, and
to increase its prices. If it succeeds, it crowds too much
labor into industries in which competition is free. It
mislocates labor, and reduces its productivity and pay.
'Is not the world full of monopolies, and are not wages
thereby reduced?

Trusts are held somewhat ill check by the fact that
they cannot greatly raise prices without causing new
competitors to appear. If this check were efficient
enough, they would not depress stages; since that is
done only by dislocating labor, and this, again, is due
to curtailing production.

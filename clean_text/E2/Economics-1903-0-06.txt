with the beginnings of democracy in the mediseval
communes, or with its development amid the Alps of
Switzerland or the dunes of Holland; alld tlle same
Puritans were unable to put on a firnl foundation at
home the democracy which they easily established ila
the new world. So it is with the love of liberty and
indiviclualism. Liberty is alway s the collcotnitant of
economic equality, or at all events of the equality of
economic opportunity. When this equality was almost
from the outset excluded, as in the South throut,h the
pressure of an economic environment based on all
abundance of free soil, well suited to an exterlsive and
quasi-tropical tillage, the result was a disappearance ot
liberty for all but the governing class. It took but a
few generations for the sturdy and liberty-loving patriots
of England and Scotland to become sincere and devoted
believers in the tlecessity and the beneficence of slavery.
The so-called Anglo-Saxon love of liberty went the
way of the old Roman boast of freedom when the world
conquests, with their supply of fresll land, made slavery
an economically profitable system. What a gllastly
mockery that the proud assertion in our Declaration of
Independence as to all tnen being born equal and with
the natural right to liberty should be signed by so large
a proportion of slaveholders !
And what shall we say of the boasted Anglo-Saxon individualism
? How does it happen that the Englishman,
leaving his moist and fertile home for the arid and
barren wastes of the antipodes, becomes, if not a socialist,
at all events the next remove to one ? Why is it
that in Australia we find the governtnent railroads, and
the government insurance, and the government steamship,
and the government frozen meat industry, and the

exchequer, as well as oil the domestic consumer, in the
bounty-giving countries; and they were upheld by a
senseless spirit of international jealousy. Repeated
attempts to get rid of them by international conferences
showed that the cheap supply to the British consumer,
and the embarrassment of the West Indian planter and
the British refiner, rested not on the solid basis of perManently
improved production, but on the uncertain
support of troublesome legislation. It might well be
argued that these conditions would come to end sooner
or later. The longer the end was postponed, the worse
was the present dislocation of industry and the more
difficult the eventual return to a settled state of things.
No doubt these were not the only considerations that in
fact led Great Britain, the one great dumping-ground,
to serve notice that she would impose import duties
equal to the bounties, unless these were stopped.. Perhaps
this decisive step would have been taken even if it
had appeared that the bounties were to continue as a
permanent factor in the sugar trade. But it is in their
probably temporary character that the sober economist
finds justification for the policy that led to their abolition.
At all events there is tenable ground for arguing
that Great Britain, in causing them to be stamped out,
acted not only in the interest of the much-abused consumers
of sugar on the Continent, but in the permanent
interests of her own industrial organization.
The other familiar case of dumping is that of the
monopoly. Here, too, it may be maintained with much
show of reason that the diversion from the normal conditions
of industry is but temporary. Can any country
be persuaded in the long run that it is for its advantage
to support or aid, by protective duties, or by any other
method, a monopoly which mulcts the domestic con-

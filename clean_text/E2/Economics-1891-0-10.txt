very essence of social progress that as fast as we are
released by arts, inventions and improved organization
from- cares and labors which have worn and
wearied us, we should create for, ourselves new wants
which shall take up all the time and strengths thus
set free; and that it is not rest man needs, but work.
Yet still again the moment of depression will come
to the stoutest and the most fortunate. Shall we, then,
wonder that many, less happy or less strong, should
succumb in the struggle and be ready to surrender
individuality, with its anxieties and burdens, but
with also its glory and its power, for an all-absorbing
Nationalism, which promises, however futilely and
foolishly, to make life forevermore easy and pleasant?
It is in a somewhat different tone that one would
speak of the apparent growth of the so-called Single
Tax party in the United States. Here is no economic
absurdity. Tphe normal workings of the principle of
self-interest in dealing with the land are observed
and respected by Mr. George, at least in his later
utterances. Nor is there anything in his central
proposition which can properly be called impracticable.
The questions which would arise in the legislature
or in the administrative bureau, regarding
details, adjustments, conflicts, exemptions, interpretations,
are not more serious than those which at the
beginning beset many a system that has in the
result vindicated its efficiency and utility. Again,
there is nothing inequitable in the suggested Single
Tax, so-called, so far as relates to future increments
of value. Conceding compensation to existing owners,
the proposition is one which an honest man can make
and an honest man can entertain.

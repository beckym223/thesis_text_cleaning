tection of a comtnon law. Accordilg to this view, the
man who would sink tlle interest of a class in a supB
posed general public interest, is but deprivillg that class
of its OWI1 natural safeguard in tlle struggle for existences
If it works for itself it gets what it can sometilnes
more than it ougllt, sometilnes less tllan it ought; but in
a reasonably well-ordered civil societ5J it takes its cllallces
witll the others. If a silogle group, in its zeal for tlle
general good, otnits to pursue its OWll grOllp illtereSt, it
causes a want of balallce betweell tlle parts, upsets tlle
conditions of the gaule, and cotltributes rather to its
OWI1 annillilation than to the predolninallce of those
conceptions witll which it has iclelltified itself. Let us
llave fair play; let t1S have a fair cllance for collflicting
views to strugt,le olae with allotller, as a cotlditioIl of
progress for the whole society. This is the cry amolog
no small nulnber of those who think they have studied
the collditions of moderll progress most carefully.
Widespread alld plausible as are sollle of these views,
I desire to take fulldalnental issue with those who support
them.
The system of political ethics just outlilled is an outgrowth
of ollr experience with two importallt institu
tions, competition and represelltative government.
Competitioll has led people to see llow frequently the
self-interest of tlle individual, as given free play, confl

governmellt llas showll how a full expressioll of
opinioll by those wllo speak for the several parts or
classes in the commullity can be made to colltribllte to an
advance whicll inures to the advantage of all parts and all
classes together. Yet in the face of these facts, I believe
tllat the theory of struggle and cotnpromise as a normal
mealls of progl-ess neecls restatement; and that the lnall

probletus two thousand years ago. But I llave faitil to
believe that this is not the fate marked out for us to-day.
I believe that the Alzlericall people and the moderll civilized
world in general will solve these probletus, as they
have solved other problems which have come up iul tlle
successive phases of their llistory; that we shall meet
the new collective 1leecls of indllstry alld goverlllllent
witll a true collectivisIn of spirit alld purpose. Not
with that superEcial collectivism or socialism which,
like the individualism that it strives to supersede, often
allalces too much of mere political machinery, and believes
that mel] are to be savecl by their institutions
rather than their cllaracters; but with a public spirit
which detnallds, as a part of the natiollal ethics, that
lnen shall shape their course on the basis of COllViCtiOll
rather thala of colllpromise, alld that public discussion
shall look toward a commoIl ullclerstalldillg rather than
a bargaill. Because the political aled colllonercial Illethods
of the past have led to coillproulise rather thall conViCtiOll,
or because the successflll lllan of affairs must be
read^T to compromise wllere he fails to convince, let us
llot say that all politics and all commerce is but a tissue
of compromises, alld that a political or comlllercial
sciellce which pretends to be sometlling broader alld
better thall this, is all illusion. Let us as ecollomists
take the opportunity that lies lDefore us, ill tlle face of
new collditiolls for whose treatmellt the old methods are
plOVillg themselves inadequate. Let us employ our Ullw
derstallding with regard to public lleecls as a lllealls of
evokillg public spirit. Let us use svllatever special
kllowledge we have witll all the breadtll of ptlrpose
which it is in our power to attain, aold make ourselves,
as becomes lnen of science, representatives of llotlling
less thall the whole truth.

times, after a certain point had been reached in agriculture
and commerce, human ingenuity was powerless
to do more than divide existing wealth; and with this
Exed litnit to production, it is no wonder that each civilization
in turn should have attempted to secure the prize
for itself. Hence the rise, the glory, alld the decline of
nations. In future, however, in lieu of dividing existing
wealth, each nation which lives up to its opportunities
will be able to create new wealth. For we must not
forget that science is not only boundless in its possibilities,
but ilz-partial in its activities. Science transcends
all national lines. Never again will a country be able to
achieve or to retain a monopoly of industrial advantages.
For the time being, indeed, climatic conditions or racial
characteristics may give olle natioll a temporary preponclerance
in some particular category of production;
but with the overwhelllling importance of new industrial
lllethods applicable impartially to all natural forces,
the advantage cannot be perlnanently retained.
We are accustomed to speak of the economic and
social changes brought about by the alteration in the
media of transportation and the growth of the world
luarket; we do not yet realize the full implication of the
industrial revolution. Rightly conceived it means the
coming internationalistn of mighty etnpires, in friendly
competition with each other, not for the clivision of what
exists, but for the utilization of what can be made to
exist. For the immediate future, indeed, while nations
are still in uneqally developed stages of industrial
growth and while there remains extended markets not
yet on the highroad to industrial predominance, there
will still be some room for the nationalism of the old
type with its protective features and its cotumercial
struggles. Ill these contests we must undoubtedly take

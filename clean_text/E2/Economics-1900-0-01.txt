At our meeting a year ago, I had the honor to address
this Association on the relations betweell ecollomics and
politics. At that time I sought to indicate at once the
need of all increase of influellce to be exerted by economists
upon the political world, and the method by which
such increase might best be attained. On the fact tlaat
such a change was needed there seemed to be no difference
of opillion. But on the llletllod by which it was
to be accomplished there was much more diversity of
view. Certain members went so far as to regret tlaat in
the brief time which was given for discussion no adequate
opporttlnity was aSorded them to develop differellt,
and to soone degree antagonistic, ideas, with regard to
the mealls to be pursued in order to increase the influence
of the economist in modern political life. The
presellt address is in some sellse a continuation of that
which was delivered a year ago. It is an endeavor to
expand more fully the argument on those points where
the members of the Association felt themselrres rnost
doubtful. In its preparation I have been actuated
throughout by the desire to give the fullest opportunity
for the discussion of difficult questions; and I believe
that its chieE value will lie in the stimulus which it gives
for such discussion.

no fundamental principle. A set of writers, especially
among contemporary German economists, take what
purports to be a severely judicial attitude. In their view
there is no established theory. and no reason for ascribing
greater validity to the doctrine of free-trade
than to that of protection. It is all a matter of advantage
-or disadvantage in the given case. Some countries
may prove on inquiry to need free-trade, some
protection. A policy of opportunism is the only sensible
one, and the controversies about theories of international
exchange turn onl barren abstractions, which
do not touch the concrete facts of industry.
For myself, I confess to little patience with this attitude.
It assumes to be large-minded and judicial, and
a certain tinge of contempt for the old fashioned
theorists often goes with it. Yet in truth it rests, I can
not but suspect, on inability or unwillingness to follow
the threads of intricate reasoning. No doubt it is true
that the concrete circumstances of a country must be
examined and considered before we apply to it a given
policy. But it is none the less essential to make up
our minds as to the principles on which our policy
should rest. No doubt it is especially true that, in
weighing the chance of the advantageous application
of protection to young industries, the actual conditions
of each case and the prospects of success should be
carefully studied. But it is none the less necessary to
reflect what are the foundations and limitations of such
protection, and what are the real tests of success. On
all such questions of principle, we often find a sad lack
of clear-cut reasoning among our German colleagues.
This defect does not show itself solely in the protective
controversy. It appears in almost every part of
the economic field, as soon as the more difficult problems

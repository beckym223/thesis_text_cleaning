in the United States than in European countries, and
wages higher; and it is no less certain that, whichever
system we shall have in the future, we shall retain these
same advantageous conditions.

But while the generally higher range of wages in the
United States has nothing to do with protection, and
probably not much to do with international free trade
either, it does not follow that some among our laborers
may not be dependent on the tariff barriers for their
present wages in their present occupations. So far as
the industries in which they are employed are really
dependent on protection, the high wages paid in these
particular cases are also dependent on protection. Looking
at the dominant and normal conditions of industry
in this country, we find high money wages and at the
same time low prices of goods. Labor is efficient and
goods are produced abundantly; therefore, though the
goods are sold at low prices, the gross money yield is
large, the money returns are high, and high money
wages are paid. But in those industries in which labor
is less efficient, and goods are not produced in abundance,
the gross money yield can not be high unless competing
products are kept out or handicapped. In this sense,
and to this extent, the maintenance of high wages in
some industries depends on the maintenance of protection.


To say this is to say that here, as in all cases of
vested interests, whether of labor or of capital, serious
problems present themselves to the legislator. The
protectionists naturally exaggerate the extent to which
industries are in fact dependent on this system, and indeed
go to the absurd extreme of maintaining that all
successful industry and all high wages depend on their
panacea, The free-traders belittle it, and often fail to

in human life. But it is a great thing to have
the whole nation at school in political economy; and
we are no wise teachers, no natural leaders, if we can
lot succeed in getting a hearing for all we have to

.The reasons why the vaguest and wildest schemes
for human regeneration, upon an economic basis, so
readily find a hearing and a wide popular acceptance,
are, besides the primary fact already noted, namely,
that most of the teachers and disciples are new to
this kind of thinking, three in number:

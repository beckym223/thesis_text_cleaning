learn of his troubles and obstacles can tell us little as to
the extent to which his successor in modern times needs
the prop of legislative aid in new ventures.
Looking now at modern experience in protection to
young industries, what result do we find? The answer,
alas, is not certain. Sometimes we seem to find a degree
of success, sometimes of failure. The besetting difficulty
of all purely inductive inquiry in the doings of
man is ever present. We can not isolate causes. We
can not apply protection to a country, and make sure
that everything else remains unchanged. A protective
duty may be followed by an increase of domestic production,
by a new and independent industry, by an
eventual benefit to the community in the way of cheaper
commodities; but the question always will remain
whether other causes have been at work, and whether
the same result would not have ensued without the
tariff in favor of the young industry.
Contrast the history of Germany and of France. For
the whole period up to i86o, France had a restrictive
regime of the greatest severity. Yet I have seen no
evidence adduced that, during that period of rapid industrial
advance in the world at large, any' gain was secured
by France in the way of successfully establishing
an industry that was able to hold its own without aid.
In Germany, on the other hand, the trend of opinion
among competent observers seems to be that, at least
during the second third of the century, the tariff policy
of the Zollverein, though much more moderate than
that of France during the same period, nurtured German
manufacture to advantage. The establishment of free
trade within Germany by this beneficent customs union
opened great possibilities of internal growth, which were

growth of a new idealism. What is tlle real import of
these faetors ?

First, tlle virtual disappearanee of free lancl. Tllis
lnakes slavery forever impossible in the future. Reeellt
investigations have proved beyond the peradventure of
a dollbt tllat slavery as a typieal eeonomie system is
ascribalJle to tlle existellee of vast quantities of untilled
tlJacts sllitable for agrieulture. Wllere any one ean procllre
fresll lalld for notllillg, he will not readily work for
allotller; alld wllell tlle soil is so exuberantly fertile
that it eall endure tlle wastefullaess of slave eultivation,
eolnplllsorv alld not volu}ltary labor will be the dominant
ellaraeteristic of tlle produetion. Slavery did not beeollle
illlportant in Greeee 1lntil tlae eolollies yielded vast
stretclles of virgin land g the yeotnall farmer in Rome
did not disappear until the world eollquests of the later
republic threw into the lnarket sueh prodigious supplies
of new territory as to ll-lake slave labor on the large
estates luerative. It was preeisely the same eause that
produeecl slavery in the West Indies and owl the Aloleriean
eontinent. Those days, however, have gone, never to
return. Fresh sllpplies of that kind of land are with
insignifieant exeeptions no longer proeurable. Tlle
older eountries are quite filled up, and in the newer
seetions eollditions are unfavorable. In both Australia
and Siberia the elitIlate is inimieal to slavery. In South
Ameriea the patnpas are the home of a grazing rather
than of an agrieultural eoulmnnity, and it is well know
tllat the floek tending and llerdillg life is not eondueive
to slavery on a large seale; on the otller lland, the agrieultural
regions of South Ameriea have realized tllat
slave produetion is inadequate to meet the eompetition
of free labor in the world rtlarket where their produets
are sold. It is only in the mining distriets of South

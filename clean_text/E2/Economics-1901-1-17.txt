It seems to llle that it would be just as reasonable to
expect the average yOUllg man to select tlle subjects
withollt assistance which woulcl be of special value to
hilll as eolnmercial trailling frotn a list of a tllousand
elective courses, as it woulcl be to expeet the young tllall
looking forward to law to select in tlle salne xvay the
subjects which would be of nlost advantage to him, if
these letal subjects xvere thrown into a pot along witll
the rest. I believe tllat it is the duty of the llniversity,
as such, to assist in eclllcating the comlnullity to the clesirability
of takillg higher professioleal alld teehnieal
education; and one of the most efficient ways of doing
this grantecl that the university has llndertaken this
function=-is to call attention to tlle Sact that it claitlls
to be doing that very xvork. The institutioll whicll offers

forget what an extremely small part we play today
in the life of the Ameriean people. To the average
Alnerican boy tTle eollege or ulliversity is still an Ullknown
territory, witll the lnention of wllieh he eonnects
no very clefilaite iclea. A!tally of tl-lel-n do not know
whetller there be any university or not, or if there is
sueh a thing, svhat it is, ancl what its pllrpose. Bllt when
yoll tell the boy who llas a notion that he woulel like to
be a physieiall, that tlle ulliversity orfers the ehallee to
learn how to beeome a physieiall, ancl if you tell the
boy \07:o WOtllCl like to be a better fal-luer, that the ulliversity
offers faeilities for aequiring that aclded infomlation
and experienee lle would like to have, tlle llotiOll
beeomes definitely eoncrete to lliln, and he looks forward
with pleasure and zest to the idea of attellcling sueh an
instittltion. Wllen yotl say to the boy who is going into

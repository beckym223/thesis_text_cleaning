The topics on which I propose to touch this evening
lie in the borderland between economics, politics, and
psychology. This sounds formidable; but my subject
is after all of a very simple sort. I shall consider the
motives that actuate able men in the conduct of large
industrial enterprises, and the possibility of enlisting in
greater degree the services of such men in the administration
of public business. I shall consider further some
of the conditions under which democracy must work,
and some ways in which democracy may perhaps work
better in the future. These are matters to which all
thoughtful men have been compelled to give attention
in recent years. I can offer nothing novel on them, and
shall be content if only I succeed in strengthening
familiar conclusions or illustrating afresh familiar
principles.
When Nassau Senior, perhaps the most scholarly and
wide-minded economist of the British school, enumerated
the postulates of political economy, he contented
himself with mentioning a single trait in human
nature. He set forth such fundamental things as the
law of diminishing returns, the tendency of population
to increase, and so on; and then went on to state in the
simplest terms the one motive from whose working he
conceived that useful conclusions could be drawn: " that
every man desires to obtain additional wealth with as
little sacrifice as possible." This was among the postulates
of the science: something so self-evident, or so
completely established by other sciences, that the economist
might accept it once for all as a basis for further
reasoning.
No doubt the ready acceptance of this proposition as
simple and self-supporting was due to the general intellectual

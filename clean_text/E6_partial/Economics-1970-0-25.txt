For an appreciable period to come, even
a slow downtrend of the progress-yields
would leave a significant differential be-
tween the average social rate of return
from the progress-activities and the con-
ventionally defined marginal rate of re-
turn from physical investment. One is
tempted to add that, given the size of this
differential, it should be possible to pro-
mote the gradual shifting of a larger pro-
portion of our inputs into the various prog-
ress-activities without forcing the marginal
social rates on these below the marginal
rates on physical investment (the latter
being an activity which does not come in
fixed proportions with technological prog-
ress). In my appraisal, this statement, too,
makes very good sense. But even if most
people should agree with this statement,
and yet there should be substantial dis-
agreement on the nature of the projects
that satisfy the marginal criteria, the pos-
sibility of increasing the weight of the new-
knowledge sector would still depend on
how well the political mechanism is cap-
able of bridging the differences. In view of
this, I will end with a question in bargain-
ing theory: Is it realistic to expect that the
propensity to reach compromises can be
increased by making the bargaining parties
aware of the fact that the joint payoff on
reaching agreement is high?

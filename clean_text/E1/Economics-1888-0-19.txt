efforts of laborers of the several sections and trades
of the couiitry towards the improvement of their
condition:, a source of much inspiration, through the
deliberations alld debates of earnest mnen represent-
ing the better sense and higher purposes of vast
bodies of laborers who are, ill the main, right-miinided,
honest, and patriotic.
Nor is it fair, nor is it worthy of any thinICier or
scholar, to attribute to esseiltial vices in such a scheme
the mistakes, errors, and follies hardly separable
from the beginniiigs of so great and wide-reaching an
enterprise. Tried by such a test free government
itself was once pronounced a failure.
But I cannot conceal my conviction that the attempt
to embrace so much within the sway of any human
authority; to legislate in detail for so many con-
flicting interests; to cover with any single rule con-
ditions of life and labor so widely diverse as those of
city and country, of east and west, of agriculturist
and artizan, of common and skilled labor, will inevi-
tably result in failure. The restiveness shown by
many of the trade-unions, the open revolt in some
cases, already intimate the weakness of the scheme,
if it is to be administered in the masterful spirit of
the past two years.
Whether the organization known as the Knights
of Labor is to break up in a general insurrection of
its constituent members; or is to lapse into "an in-
nocuous desuetude," relinquishing to the trade-unions
their former authority over their own members, re-
taining for itself but the shadow of the ilame; or is
to take on a form and assume functions compatible
with industrial peace and with the steady and even
progress of trade and production, will depend somewhat

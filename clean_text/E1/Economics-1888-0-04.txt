and wages, alike in large matters and in small, they
should have to do with men -who are acute and alert
in seeking out opportunities for their own industrial
improvement, with men who are persistent and courageous
in following up every possible industrial advantage,
when once it has been riightly discerned;
that they should have to do, not with men who have
no opinion for themselves, what they ought to receive,
and who humbly and thankfully take that
which may be given, but with men who, not less as
laborers than as citizens, shall know their rights and,
knowing, dare maintain.
In a word, we have recently passed through a
change in economic opinion equally important with,
and indeed closely analogous to, that great change in
political opinion, which began more than a hundred
years ago, and which was accomplished, not without
trouble and turmoil, not till after great waste and
hideous losses, about the middle of this century.
Under the old regime, the accepted philosophy of
government declared that certain privileged persons
and classes were the natural and proper guardians of
the mass of the people; that the interests of all, rich
and poor, high and low, were so bound up together
that if one member suffered the others must suffer
with it; that, inasmuch as the state could only be
Wealthy and strong through the prosperity of all,
there was in this a sufficient guaranty against abuse
and neglect of the lower classes on the part of the
higher, and that, under these conditions, all authority
might, not only safely but advantageously, be lodged
with that part of the community which had the most
leisure, and aptitude for government, in which resided
the highest intelligence, the widest culture, the
strongest instincts of command.

political economy from this subjection to an alien
authority. Not only is it fully recognized that "right
divine" has no more to do with economics than with
politics; that men should inquire what is best for
them, in matters of industry equally as in matters of
government, without any presumption from arrangements
supposed to have been made for them; but
the subserviency of temper which, for longer or
shorter times, always survives the breaking of
the bands of authority, has wholly disappeared.
Economics have become as completely freed from
-the trammels of " natural theology," as has geology
from the restraints of "revealed religion," investigators
in either department of inquiry owning no
other obligation than that of declaring the truth as
-they discern it.
The genesis of the doctrine of Laissez-Faire, as
expressing a principle to which is attributed universal
applicability and unqualified validity, might
be variously accounted for. It would seem, on the
first thought, to be the child of economic thinking,
under conception from the theory of a beneficent
order of creation. Yet, as Professor Sidgwick has
intimated, this doctrine might as logically be derived
rfiom a purely pessimistic as from a highly optimistic
view of nature, one economist concluding that nothing
needs to be done but to open and smooth the
way to a return to the natural order, because he
believes that natural order to be wholly beneficent,
while another economist should reach the conclusion
that there is no use in trying to do anything to improve
upon the actual situation, because he believes
the arrangements of the universe to be hopelessly
adverse and malignant.

In the. industrial republic, as in the political repub-
lic, power com-es to the masses accompanied by the
gravest responsibilities, and in one as in the other
the abuse or the wanton exercise of power will inflict
its worst injuries upon the humblest members of the
commulnUity. In et-lher republic instruction as to the
duties and responsibilities of citizenship is more
needed than instruction as to the right and powers
of citizenship. Certainly during the past few years
there has been much ignore thought of the latter than
of the former among, those who assume to prom-note the
interests of the laboring class; yet nothing could be
mnore prejudicial t'o those interests, when rightly
view-Ted, than that the impression should be created
am-iong the body of wNiorking me i that there is any-
thing they can take without giving its fair and full
equivalent; that they can use the immense force
which resides in co neerted action without direct and
immediate accountability for every injury which may
be inflicted thereby upon production and trade; thalt
they can harass employers by incessant deLmands,
extort undue concessions, and render it unsafe to
undertake contracts, involving large expendittures
extending over considerable periods of time, without
in the result suffering far m-ore evil than they can
possibly inflict upon the employing or the capitalist
class. Emnphatically it is true in industrial warf-are,
that they who take the sword shall perish by the
sword, and those are only enemies of the working
classes who incite them -to take up arms in a light
quarrel, or, in any cause, without counting well and
carefully the cost.
Such and so grave are the responsibilities which
attend all efforts of the laboring classes to improve

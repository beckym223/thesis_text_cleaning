It was gravely and elaborately argued that
all classes of producers were so intimately bound up
together that no one could be made to suffer but all
should straightway suffer with it; that, therefore,
the employing class, alert, intelligent, constantly in-
formed as to the state of trade, with, moreover, the
largest stake in the result, could safely be left to de-
termine the proper wages of their workmen, their
own interests requiring them to pay the most that
could, in the condition of the market, possibly be
paid. Nay, the security which the laboring class
enjoyed, under the regime of aristocratic economics,
was, in one respect, superior to that which the lower
classes enjoyed under the regime of aristocratic poli-
tics. In the field of government, the security against
wrong was found only in the retribution suffered by
the ruling classes, a retribution in which the humbler
members of society must also share; but, in the field
of industry, anl additional security to the laboring
classes was derived. from the fact that any undue
profits which their employers might, for a time, real-
ize, through unjustly beating down wages, would
become, of necessity, a new demand for labor, result-
ing in wages proportionately advanced; and thus the
wrong would be automatically and surely righted.
It is only fifteen years since propositions to the
foregoing effect were deliberately and emphatically
re-stated by eminent writers on both sides of the
Atlantic.
What was it which banished aristocratic politics,
not merely from political philosophy but from the
constitutions of Europe, so that, to-day, there is not,
besides Russia, a nation which has not, in the lan-
guage of Thucydides, takenn its citizens into partnership

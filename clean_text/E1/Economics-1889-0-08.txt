or procedure. Indeed, the tone in which this argu-
ment has been used shows that it was not regarded
as admitting a reply.
I have no quarrel with natural theology; but I do
assert the right of political economy to be entirely
independent of it. If the established order of things
be really beneficent, any social arrangement which
can be shown to be natural can be shown, by an
adequate induction from the observed facts of its
operation, to be coniducive to human happiness. If
that can be shown, it is enough for the statesman or
the economist. What need have we of further wit-
ness? On the other hand, those who do not believe
in a golden age; who believe that mankind were
once naked, hairy savages, living in caves and for-
ests, subsisting on wild fruits or raw flesh, the latter,
often, of their own kind, using stone implements,
and, for uncounted generations, ignorant even of the
use of fire, have the right to protest against the em-
ployment of this argument; and to demand that any
social arrangement, any procedure, any institution,
which is claimed to be for good shall be proven to be
such by evidence which they can accept.
It would not do to take the time that would be ne-
cessary to show, by adequate citation, how extensive
has been the perversion of economic inquiry, caused
by the subjection of political economy to the sup-
posed claims of natural theology, especially in the
United States, where the two chairs were often
united, as of old, in Adam Smith's case. Nor is this
necessary. The matter is now one of historical in-
terest only. The temper of self-assertion, proper to
the teachers of any subject, has been re-enforced by
the spiritt of the age," to the point of finally freeing

and have carried these to extremes subversive
of the general interest and even threatening the ex-
istence of society itself, have not been men born on
our soil, bred under our laws and trained in our
schools. Such movements may, here and there, have
found native leaders, whose superior education and
political training gave them influence over the in-
flamed masses of labor; but the force and impulse of
these attacks upon social interests, and even upon
society itself, has been of foreign derivation; while
every out-break- of violence which has accompanied
the labor troubles of the last two years, whether in
Chicago, or St. Louis, or at Rock Springs, has uni-
formly been characterized by the almost, if not alto-
gether, complete absence of participants of native
birth. In the atrocious assault upon the Chinese,
which occurred at the last-mentioned place in the
year 1885, in which nearly fifty aLnoffending persons
lost their lives, it was ascertained that miot omne man
born upon our soil was engaged.
It is not a matter of surprise, perhaps not alto-
gether a matter of blame, that men reared under in-
stitutions of pure force, miany of them bred in an
atmosphere of conspiracy, cherishing traditions of
political injustice, perhaps inheriting bitter hatred
of law anmd government, at the best uuntrained ii
political action and unaccustomed to -the responisibili-
ties of citizenship, should exhibit less of self-control
amid of respect for the rights of others, than miharac-
terizes the conduct of our own people. But mio feel-
imig of sympathy toward the oppressed or unfortu-
nate of other lamids, no sentiment of hospitality
toward those who have newly come among us, re-
quires that Americans should permit their own

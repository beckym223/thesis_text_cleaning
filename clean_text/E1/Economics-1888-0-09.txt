larger share of the product of industry. The gain
they have already realized has in part been due to
more favorable material conditions of existence, to
the discovery of new resources and powers in nature,
and to advances in the arts of production and tranis-

the age, in which all classes have in a greater or less

the expense of unorganized labor and of the agricul-

been the result of the more active and aggressive
pursuit of their interests by the organized working
class.
That this last part of the total eff ect should be
exaggerated, and that laborers should attribute all,
or nearly all, of what they have gained to their own
efforts is not unnatural, nor is it strange that they
look to the same course for further good to them-
selves.
It is idle for any ole to say that tle working classes
have, indeed, accomplished much for themselves by
their combined efforts in the past, but that we have
now reached the industrial stage when nothing more
is to be expected from this source, and laborers should,
therefore, rest content with what they have already
won. No living man knows enough of the conditions
of industry to justify him in asserting anything like

body of laborers, at least if we can trust to the ex-
pressions of their organs and orators, have becom-ie so
exaggerated, and the interpretation which they place
upon the success attained in the past is so far strained
or false, as to make it probable that large bodies of
working men in different parts of our country will

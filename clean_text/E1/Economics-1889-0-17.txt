lo! that nature itself began to undergo a profound
and pervasive change on its economic side; a
change so sweeping and far-reaching that it has come
about that the men of certain countries, those of
which we know most and with which we have most
to do, have, for the purposes of economic reasoning,
become, as it were, in the phrase of Burke, a different
species of animal.
The doctrine, ill politics, of the guardianship of the
lower by the upper classes had its perfect counterpart
in the economic doctrine that the employing
class are the natural trustees of the laboring class.
The aristocratic politics of the last century declared
that it did not matter how much power was entrusted
to the privileged classes, since the interests of all,
rich and poor, high and low, were so bound up together
that 1o1 class could suffer and others not suffer with
it; and, consequently, that the class most intelligent,
most apt for government, having the greatest leisure
for public affairs, with, moreover, the largest stake
in the community, might advantageously be trusted
to make and execute all laws, their own interests
inhibiting them from any course of action prejudicial
to the lower classes, who might, theref ore, safely
submit to rule, in the happy assurance that they
could not be in any way injured or oppressed.
Closely analogous to this was the argument by
which, in what I would, without offense, call the
aristocratic economics of the early part of the century,
it was sought to be shown that it was not important,
or, indeed, desirable, that the laboring class
should take any active part in the distribution of
wealth; should feel any responsibility for asserting
and maintaining their own interests in that distribution.

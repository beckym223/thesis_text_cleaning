 161] Tke Manuawl Lalorbhg Class. 11 
 It is not necessary to recite the arguments from 
 reason or the blows from force by which "owe have 
 changed all this" in the domain of politics. It is 
 now universally seen and admitted that there is no 
 security against tyranny, save in the power and dis- 
 position to resist and resent tyranny; that the masses 
 of the people are the only proper and safe guardians 
 of their own interests; that it is just as truly and 
 just as much for the welfare of the upper classes as 
 of the lower classes themselves, that the latter should 
 be bold and resolute, quick to see their interests, 
 prompt to assert them, persistent in maintaining 
 them. 
 In economic opinion the change, may I not say 
 the revolution? began much later; but it has been 
 carried through at once more rapidly and more peace- 
 fully: first, because the other revolution had already 
 been effected, preparing the way for this; and, 
 secondly, because of the greater volume and force of 
 entirely disinterested sentiment operating in the 
 later case. 
 It would scarcely be conceivable to-day that an 
 economist of learning and reputation should gravely 
 argue that the employer is, in effect, a trustee of the 
 laborer's wages, and that it really does not matter 
 whether, in any given time and place, he pays the 
 laborer more or pays him less, since by as much as 
 the employer may under-pay the laborer in any in- 
 stance, by so much will he certainly and indefeasibly 
 over-pay him in some subsequent instance. The eco- 
 nomists now see, what the workmen long ago saw, 
 that each man is the natural trustee of his own earn- 
 ings, and that these are only safe when paid into his 
 own hands.

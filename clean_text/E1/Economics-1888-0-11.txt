 1671 The Jfautal Laborigy Class. 17 
 talists aiid philanthropists yearned for it on their 
 account; not because the demand was enforced by 
 uiiitecl action, carried to a point which threatened 
 the employers with loss or, perhaps, ruin; but it has 
 been for the reason that the conditions of production 
 and trade allowed such concessions to be made with- 
 out impairing the disposition to accumulate capital 
 for industrial uses, and without cutting to the quick 
 into the profits of business, which, under the existing 
 organization of industry, constitute the sole motive 
 to the production of wealth. Where these conditions 
 are met the urgent, persistent demands of the labor- 
 ing class, as well as the active sympathy of the 
 general community, will undoubtedly help to secure, 
 if, indeed, they are not essential to securing advan- 
 tages which might otherwise be withheld. Where 
 these collditions are not met, demands for increasing 
 wages or shortening the term of labor will either be 
 refused by the employing class, or if enforced by 
 united action under circumstances which compel an 
 immediate compliance, they will be granted, in the 
 given time and place, only at the cost of the general 
 community, and in especial of the laboring class, 
 first of all, last of all, and most of all. 
 The part which laborers are, under modern con- 
 ditions, called to perform in influencing the distribu- 
 tion of the product of industry, is not a part in which 
 they are to do whatever is agreeable to themselves, 
 without careful consideration of the rights and in- 
 terests of others, and without direct responsibility for 
 the effects of wrongful and injudicious action. It is 
 just as fully true that there are no industrial rights 
 without corresponding duties as it is that there are 
 no political rights without corresponding duties.

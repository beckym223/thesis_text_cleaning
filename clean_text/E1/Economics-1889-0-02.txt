OWnl aggressiveness, as some of our early critics declared,
or assumed by us in proper defense and selfassertion
against a tone and a spirit in the reviews
and the accepted organs of economic orthodoxy,
which would have denied us any place to work in the
field of economics, it certainly, at the outset, existed.
This has wholly disappeared, partly, perhaps, because
of the modifications of our OWnl attitude towards
others, though not through any change in our economic
position, but chiefly because of a steady movement
of economic thought in the very direction which
was pointed out in our first articles of union. To
this movement we may fairly claim to have contributed,
though by far the greater part of it originated
in forces which we did not set in motion; which
began and had proceeded far before our association
took place.
Partly by what we have done and even more by
what has been done for us; partly through a wise and
conciliatory attitude adopted towards others, and
even more through the change wrought by the general
movement I have spoken of in the attitude of
others towards the objects we profess, it has come
about that, whereas we were looked upon at Saratoga,
in 1885, as an economic sect, we now embrace clearly
all the active economic workers of the United States.
What is that general economic movement which
has done so much more for us than we have done for
ourselves; which has had so much greater effect in
altering the relations of the Association to the economists
of the country, than any actual change in our
organization or methods, or in our avowed objects ?
This recent movement, as it is witnessed in the
United States, is, in part, only our share of a movement

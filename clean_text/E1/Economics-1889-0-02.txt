OWnl aggressiveness, as some of our early critics de-
clared, or assumed by us in proper defense and self-
assertion against a tone and a spirit in the reviews
and the accepted organs of economic orthodoxy,
which would have denied us any place to work in the
field of economics, it certainly, at the outset, existed.
This has wholly disappeared, partly, perhaps, be-

nated in forces which we did not set in motion; which
began and had proceeded far before our association
took place.

what has been done for us; partly through a wise and
conciliatory attitude adopted towards others, and
even more through the change wrought by the gen-

others towards the objects we profess, it has come
about that, whereas we were looked upon at Saratoga,
in 1885, as an economic sect, we now embrace clearly

has done so much more for us than we have done for
ourselves; which has had so much greater effect in
altering the relations of the Association to the econo-
mists of the country, than any actual change in our
organization or methods, or in our avowed objects ?
This recent movement, as it is witnessed in the
United States, is, in part, only our share of a movement

classes upon which fiscal burdens shall first fall!
What a work is laid out for the economist, as,
with all his senses alert, his very soul in strain, he
sounds and tests the public body, to detect indications
of failing resistance to fiscal pressure! What
revelations of weakness and of danger to the state
may not thereby be given to the faithful legislator!
What suggestions, of priceless value to the educator,
may not come from economic investigations undertaken
in this spirit and carried on by the methods of
modern science!
Fellow-members, such, according to my fallible
judgment and very imperfect knowledge, are the
principal causes of the remarkable economic movement
of the past few years. That movement itself
does not require to be proven. A bay, one-half
whose spaces lie bare and baking in the sun, does
not more differ in aspect from that bay, when the
sea comes rolling in, filling it full of boisterous life,
and beating with angry roar upon the rocks which
close it round, than does the economic world of a
few years ago differ from that which we look out
upon to-day.'

the rate of wages as high as it could be maintained
without an injurious reaction. The laborer was not
called upon to seek his interest ; his interest would
seek him and would find him. Even unfair methods
and a grasping spirit on the part of employers could
not, in the long result, impair the remuneration of
labor.
" :Unless." said Prof. John E. Cairnes, having in

employers, "' unless we are to suppose tthe charact ,er

led to its investment would lead to its reinvestment;
and, once reinvested, the interests of those concerned
would cause it to be distributed amongst the several
elements of capital in the same proportions as before.
In this way covetousness is held in check by covetousness,
and the desire for aggrandizement sets
limits to its own gratification."
ccIf, in the division between profits and wages,"
saiid Prof. Perry, " at the end of any industrial cycle
profits get more than their due share, those very
profits will wish to become capital, and will thus
become an extra demand for labor, and the next
wages fund will be larger than the last." And the
same economist wrote elsewhere: "If capital gets a
relatively too large reward, nothing can interrupt
the tendency that labor shall get, in consequence of
that, a larger reward the next time. If capital takes
an undue advantage of labor at any point, as unfortunately
it sometimes does, somebody, at some

,desire to employ laborers ; and so the wrong tends
to right itself."
While, thus, the action of competition among the
emiploying classes themselves, for the profits of
employment, was certain, eveni in spite of a grasping
spirit and unfair me-tIhods, to yield the highest rate
of wages which the existing conditions of industry
would allow to be paid, distinct efforts on the part
of the laboring class to secuLre a larger share of the
product, could, at the best, only be. nugatory, and
would be more than likely to prove mischievous.
How great the 'change in economic opinion!
To-day, few economists of reputation would deny
that the laboring class have as real, as large, as
vital a part to perform in securing a just and bene-
ficial distribution of the product of industry, as the
employing class. It is seen and admitted, that com-
petition must be imperfect, and, by consequence,
injurious, uLnless the laborers, on their side, are as
alert, active and, in the primary sense of that term,
as aggressive, in pursuing their economic interests,
as the old theories of distribution assumed that the
employing class would be. It is seen and admitted
that, if the workman does not seek his interest, not
only will he, in a degree, lose his interest, but,
through his failure to receive all the economic good
wiThich might with proper effort have been brought
to him, immediate injuries, tending to become per-
manent, not only may conceivably, but certainly
-will, be inflicted upon the whole industrial body.
It is seen that it is for the interest, the particular,
selfish interest of the employing class themselves,
that, in all their dealings with the questions of work

the principle of optimal taxation that
tax rates should vary with a number of elasticities.
However, the optimal tax models are
based on strong assumptions that are often
implausible or virtually impossible to validate.
Consequently, there is no empirical
basis for determining how different commodities
and sources of income should be
taxed. Moreover, the compliance and enforcement
costs of such a system could be
large enough to more than offset the potential
inefficiencies of a uniform tax. In the
absence of reliable data, it is safer to rely on
the comprehensive approach rather than to
introduce tax differentials that will generate
their own distortions.36
According to Simons and others, income
is the sum of an individual's consumption
and change in net worth during a particular
time period. For a long time, the federal
income tax base was a far cry from a comprehensive
definition of income. In 1986,
however, Congress reversed its previous
practice and enacted a wholesale tax reform
that moved the income tax a long way toward
the Simons' ideal. This remarkable
piece of legislation can provide the basis for
achieving the distributive objectives discussed
earlier with moderate tax rates.
The 1986 Tax Reform.37 The Tax Reform
Act of 1986, a major step toward comprehensive
income taxation, greatly improved
the fairness and efficiency of the tax system.
The major accomplishments of the act are as
follows:
By doubling personal exemptions and increasing
the standard deduction, the act relieved
about 5 million poor people from
paying any income tax. This step restored
the principle (abandoned by Congress in
1978) that people who are officially designated
as "poor" should not be required to
pay income tax. The principle was perpetuated
by the resumption in 1989 of an automatic
annual adjustment of the exemptions
and standard deduction for inflation.
Significant increases were made in the
earned income credit for wage earners with
families. These increases eliminated almost
the entire Social Security payroll tax (including
the employer's share) for those eligible
for the full credit and reduced the tax burden
for many low-income workers.
For the first time since 1921, realized capital
gains were made taxable as ordinary income.
This is the keystone of comprehensive
tax reform: it reduces the incentive to convert
ordinary income into capital gains and
removes one of the major elements of tax
shelter arrangements. Moreover, this change
made it possible to reduce tax rates without
reducing the progressivity of the income tax.
A good start was made to reverse the
erosion of the individual income tax base.
For example, unemployment benefits, which
were previously taxable only if a married
taxpayer's income exceeded $18,000 ($12,000
if single), were made taxable regardless of
the size of income. Deductions for state and
local sales taxes were eliminated and those
for consumer interest were phased out. For
administrative reasons, deductions for unreimbursed
business expenses, costs incurred
in earning investment income, and other
miscellaneous expenses were allowed only to
the extent that they exceed a floor of two
percent of income.
Some of the most egregious loopholes and
special tax benefits were eliminated. Many
tax shelters were rendered unprofitable by
denying deductions for losses from passive
activity against income from anything but
passive activities.3' Tax subsidies for borrowing
(other than for mortgages) were eliminated
by another limitation on the deduction
for interest expenses to the amount of
investment income reported on the individual'
s tax return.39 Deductions for contributions

As the Second World War was drawing
near its resolution, economic theory entered
a phase of intensive mathematization that
profoundly transformed our profession. In
several of its main features that phase had
no precedent, and it will have no successor.
Assessing it requires a multidimensional
analysis acknowledging the contributions to
economics that were made, as well as the
tensions among economists that were
heightened.

The development of mathematical economics
during the past half-century can be
read in the total number of pages published
each year by the leading periodicals in the
field, an index that I will follow at first.
From 1933, the date when they both started
publication, to 1959, those periodicals were
Econometrica and the Review of Economic
Studies, and the index tells of the decline
from a high point, above 700 pages in 1935
to the lowest point, below 400 pages in
1943-1944. But 1944 marked the beginning
of a period of explosive growth in which
Econometrica and the Review of Economic
Studies were joined in 1960 by the International
Economic Review, in 1969 by the
Journal of Economic Theory, and in 1974 by
the Journal of Mathematical Economics. In
1977, these five periodicals together published
over 5,000 pages. During the period
1944-1977, the index more than doubled
every nine years. By that measure, 1944 was
a sharp turning point in the history of mathematical
economics. It was also the year in
which John von Neumann and Oskar
Morgenstern published the Theory of Games
and Economic Behavior.

While the professional journals in the field
of mathematical economics grew at an unsustainably
rapid rate, the American Economic
Review underwent a radical change
in identity. In 1940, less than 3 percent of
the refereed pages of its 30th volume ventured
to include rudimentary mathematical
expressions. Fifty years later, nearly 40 percent
of the refereed pages of the 80th volume
display mathematics of a more elaborate
type.

At the same time, the mathematization of
economists proceeded at an even faster pace
in the 13 American departments of economics
labeled by a recent assessment of
research-doctorate programs in the United
States (Lyle V. Jones et al., 1982) as "distinguished"
or "strong" according to the
scholarly quality of their faculties. Every
year the Fellows of the Econometric Society
(ES) certify new members by election into
their international guild, which increased in
size from 46 in 1940 to 422 in 1990. For
those 13 departments together, the proportion
of ES Fellows among professors was
less than 1 percent in 1940; it is now close
to 50 percent. It equals or exceeds 50 percent
for six of them, which were among
those assessed as the eight strongest. So
mathematized a faculty expects its students
to have what it considers to be minimal
mathematical proficiency, and knowledge of
calculus and linear algebra is required, or
forcefully recommended, for admission to
all 13 graduate programs.
Several scholarly recognitions lay additional
emphasis on the role that mathematical
culture is now playing in our profession.
Of the 152 members of the economics section
of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, 87 are Fellows of the Econometric
Society; and of the 40 members of the economics
section of the National Academy of

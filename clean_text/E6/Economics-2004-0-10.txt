B. Labor Incentives
The implicitly uniform-price annuitization in
Social Security also affects labor market incen-
tives. The use of uniform annuity pricing (over-
all or within still heterogeneous risk classes)
violates the conditions for first-best optimiza-
tion. Compared to first-best pricing, the deci-
sion that would be distorted is that of labor
supply. If annuity pricing is breakeven, then
some are being taxed on work while others are
being subsidized compared to a system where
annuities are priced for individual life expec-
tancies. An alternative counterfactual would be
a failure to annuitize at all. Without annuitiza-
tion, we would have more accurate labor market
incentives person-by-person, but earnings would
finance less satisfactory consumption trajecto-
ries. We would fail to insure not only life ex-
pectancy realizations but also changes in life
expectancy as information accrues. That is,
even unfair annuities can raise individual wel-
fare if the alternative is no annuities.
I conclude that having a mandated retirement
income program provide its benefits as annu-
ities is sensible.
III. Workers and Families: Young Child,
Spouse, and Survivor Benefits
Social Security provides more than just re-
tirement benefits for workers. It provides bene-
fits for disabled workers and their families, for
young children of a deceased worker, and for
elderly spouses and surviving spouses. In addi-
tion, a divorced spouse may be eligible for the
same benefits as a spouse if the marriage lasted
at least ten years.31 Benefits other than worker
benefits are referred to as auxiliary benefits.
These benefits are subject to a maximum
rule-a beneficiary receives the largest benefit
he or she is eligible for-with no increment for
also being eligible for a smaller benefit. That is,
if someone has worked at least ten years, on
retirement he or she is eligible for a retired
worker benefit. He or she is also eligible for a
spouse benefit if married to a retired worker
beneficiary. But the total amount of benefit is
equal to the maximum of the two benefits. Sim-

ilarly, someone eligible for a worker benefit and
also eligible for a survivor benefit receives only
the larger benefit.32 A central design feature is
that these auxiliary benefits are not paid for on
an individual basis-workers with the same
earnings history receive the same retired worker
benefits whether or not they have family mem-
bers or ex-spouses collecting auxiliary benefits.
Auxiliary benefits raise four questions. Does
it make sense to mandate benefits for family
members and ex-spouses? Does it make sense to
base benefits on a maximum rule? Does it make
sense to finance all of the auxiliary benefits
from the program as a whole rather than in part  or in full from the benefits of the retired worker?
Are the details of benefit determination rules as
well-designed as might be?
Let me start with the first, most basic ques-
tion. It makes sense to provide auxiliary benefits
since studies suggest that significant numbers of
workers do not insure their lives adequately and
would not make good choices between single-
and joint-life annuities. More generally we are
learning more about the ways in which the
allocation of resources within the family does
not conform to a single maximization with a
single budget constraint. Since the government
cares about the different family members (and
not just the worker), direct allocations to family
members matter since they will change the al-
location of resources within the family. Protect-
ing family members is a role governments have
recognized for centuries.
The other questions are more complex and
need more detailed analyses. Two issues are
central here. These are the positive and norma-
tive issues of how consumption is actually al-
located within families and how to combine
evaluations and rules that affect both individu-
als and families. Research on the determination
of allocations within the family is still in an
early stage of development. And normative
analysis has not progressed much beyond iden-
tification of the dilemma in recognizing both

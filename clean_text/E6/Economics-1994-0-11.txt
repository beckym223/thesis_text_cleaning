likely, unless the relationship between in-
ventions and the number of patents applied
for has been changing.
The suspicion that the relationship be-
tween the number of patents and the num-
ber of inventions (weighted by their relative
economic importance) has been changing is
not new. Schmookler (1966) stops most of
his analysis with pre-World War II data,
believing that the meaning of the patent
statistics changed at that time. What needs
to be reconciled in the data is the sharp
contrast between the rapidly growing R&D
series during 1953-1968 (and earlier) and
the essentially flat patent series. There are a
number of not mutually exclusive possibili-
ties here:
(i) The fast-growing R&D expenditures,
fueled by the new global opportunities
that opened up in the post-World War
II period, were being invested in face
of rapidly diminishing returns.
(ii) Some of the observed growth in R&D
could be spurious, the result of reclas-
sification of informal technological ac-
tivities into formal R&D under the
pressure of tax accountants, public-
relations experts, and R&D tax credits.
(iii) The rise of formal R&D-based inven-
tion crowded out smaller, less valuable
individual-inventor-based patents, while
the rise in the cost of patenting (in
terms of the time costs of dealing with
the patent system) and the more recent
sharp rise in fees may have selected out
a large number of potentially low-val-
ued patents. Given the evidence that
the value distribution of inventions and
patents is extremely skewed, with only
a small fraction having a high present
value, such a crowding out could raise
average values significantly, though the
required rate is rather on the high
side.12  It is also likely that the threshold for what
is patentable has risen, given the large in-
flux of foreign patent applications into the
U.S. system all impinging on a relatively
slow-growing and budget-constrained pat-
ent office.'3 On the other hand, the legal
status of patents in the United States has
improved significantly with the creation of a
special patents court, driving up the ex-
pected private value of a patent. Given the
presence of so many opposing forces, there
is no compelling need to reply on the
exhaustion-of-inventive-opportunities hy-
pothesis, especially since patents-to-R&D
ratios were falling much more drastically
during the "good times" of the past than
recently.14 Moreover, if we do take these
numbers seriously, then good news is just
around the corner: domestic patent applica-
tions have risen sharply in the last five years
(see Fig. 5), implying a potential resurgence
in the rate of technological change. This
leaves us, however, more or less where we
started, with the productivity slowdown
largely unexplained.

Barbara and Ann both think that their employer
should give them a nominal wage increase.
Another study, with a different form of ques-
tionnaire, independently found a similar re-
sponse. Robert Shiller found that 49 percent of
a sample of the general public either fully or
weakly agreed with the following statement: "If
my pay went up, I would feel more satisfaction
in my job, more sense of fulfillment, even if
prices went up as much." An additional 11
percent of the general public were undecided,
while only 27 percent completely disagreed. As
in the case of Ann and Barbara, such opinions
are consistent with the view that workers think
their employers should give them a nominal
wage increase: they will be disappointed when
it does not occur. Shiller's finding may be sim-
ilar to the public's view of Ann and Barbara.
But, as he reports, it is also in stark disagree-
ment with the view of professional economists
that underlies natural rate theory. Ninety per-
cent of economists weakly or strongly disagreed
with the statement; 77 percent were in complete
disagreement.77
Such norms-regarding the wage or salary in-
crease that employees think they should receive--
can be economically consequential. They cause
the long-run inflation-unemployment trade-off
to be downward sloping. With such a norm, at
higher levels of inflation workers will not expe-
rience disappointment from receiving lower
nominal wage increases than they think they
should receive; therefore, at higher inflation,
ceteris paribus, wage bargains will result in
lower real wages, which will reduce the relative
price that the firm wants to set, and therefore
raise the rate of sustainable employment. There
is a need for further research following Shafir,
Diamond, and Tversky and Shiller regarding
whether workers have norms regarding the nom-
inal wage increases they think they should receive.
High Inflation.-The opinions expressed re-
garding Barbara and Ann, and also the opinions
of Shiller's respondents, suggest that the long-
run trade-off between inflation and employment
is upward sloping. These answers were elicited
in the United States and thus are reflective of
respondents' views in an environment where
inflation has been low. But if inflation is very  high and therefore also very salient, the answers
to such questionnaires could be very different.
And they could impart a very different shape to
the trade-off between macroeconomic demand
and steady-state inflation.78 In such cases, peo-
ple may gain satisfaction only from wage and
salary increases that exceed inflation. Such
norms regarding how employers should behave
will then necessitate higher real wages (to main-
tain the same level of satisfaction) at higher
levels of inflation. The long-run inflation-
employment relation will then be downward
sloping. Such behavior gives a much stronger
rationale, even than current rational-expectations
credibility models (Barro and Gordon 1983; Ken-
neth Rogoff 1987), why central banks should
maintain price stability. Failure to appreciate this
realistic possibility again may be another case in
which the absence of norms from utility functions
has unduly blinkered macroeconomic thinking.79
77 Shiller (1997, 37).  78 Bankruptcy and financial considerations become es-
pecially important when inflation is very high. It is also  worth noting, at least parenthetically, that high levels of  bankruptcy at times of high inflation are themselves a symp-  tom of money illusion. Such bankruptcies reflect the non-  indexation of financial contracts.
79 In addition to the two questionnaire studies I have  mentioned, indexed contracts give another indicator for the  existence of nominal notions concerning what wage in-
creases should or should not be. Economists are often sur-
prised at the small fraction of union contracts that are
indexed at all. (Louis N. Christofides and Amy Chen Peng  2004, for example, analyzed a sample of almost 12,000
Canadian union contracts from 1976 to 2000. The mean
length of these contracts was slightly more than two years  (25 months). Only 19 percent of these contracts were in-  dexed.) But even when such indexation occurs, their form
violates the condition that they were struck with only real  considerations in mind. For an imperfect index such as the  CPI, which reflects both supply shocks and demand shocks,  the optimal COLA adjustment will be less than one, but it  will always be (almost) symmetric for positive and negative  deviations of inflation from a threshold. (See Jo Anna Gray  1978, Ronald G. Ehrenberg, Leif Danziger, and Gee San  1983, and David Card 1986 for the derivation of optimal  indexation.) But COLA adjustments are only positive. (Card  1986, S146, has expressed this in terms of a formula: w(t) =
w"(t) + max{0, a[p(t) - p1}, where w(t) is the nominal  wage, wn(t) is the nominal target, p(t) is the actual price  level, and p' is the threshold.) Thus, the form of the contract
violates optimality. In practice, this violation is also biting.  For example, in roughly one-third of a large Canadian  sample of indexed contracts, inflation was always below the  threshold (see Christofides and Peng 2004, 11, fn. 19). Thus,
the form of indexed contracts, when they exist, shows that  union wage negotiators think that COLA adjustments  should never be negative. The form of indexed contracts  gives another robust indicator that, indeed, wage setters

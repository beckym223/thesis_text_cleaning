cost reductions and high rates of return create
attractive investment opportunities which,
when acted upon, bring about a high capital
contribution to growth. It should be no surprise
that under such circumstances the GDP growth
rate itself tends to be high. It should likewise
be no surprise that the opposite syndrome
with weak real cost reductions and low rates
of return producing fewer interesting investment
opportunities-should end up being associated
with a low capital contribution and a
low GDP growth rate.

Finally, we come to the residual R' itself.
To me, the biggest message here is to recognize
the multiplicity of sources from which it
can (and I believe does) come, and the additivity
that nevertheless is its attribute. I think
that the term real cost reduction very neatly
captures both these aspects in a way that renders
it preferable to terms like TFP improvement
and technical advance-preferable not
in the sense of a mechanical definition (for
which all three are equally good), but in the
sense of better conveying the underlying nature
of the process to one's listeners or readers.
The next step is to recognize that of the five
main pillars, at least three (the rate of investment,
the rate of return, and real cost reduction)
are key foci of decision-making
processes at the level of the firm. I cannot escape
the conclusion that the great bulk of the
action associated with the growth process
takes place at the level of the firm. Hence, I
feel we should focus much more study than
we have in the past on what happens at this
level. And when we are not working at the firm
level, we should pay a lot of attention to what
happens at lesser levels of disaggregation like
industries and industrial branches.
Key insights flow from taking this kind of
focus. Few economists are aware of the pervasiveness
with which sunrise-sunset diagrams
are characterized by overshooting, or of
the importance that firms or industries with
real cost increases (i.e., reductions in TFP)
play in determining the aggregate rates of real
cost reduction that we see in such diagrams.
Here we have only scratched the surface in
digesting the evidence. But I find impressive
the degree to which the data of Table 3 seem
to point to a growth syndrome in which high
rates of return, high rates of investment, high
rates of real cost reduction, and high rates of
output growth all go together. I see in this result
the likelihood that real cost reductions are
the big driving force, generating high rates of
return and calling forth high rates of investment
and high output growth. This interpretation
is compatible with many exercises that
I have perforned over the years in which I
have tried to contrast high-growth with lowgrowth
experiences. In such exercises, as in
Table 3, the difference in rates of real cost reduction
has typically been a major "source"
of the difference in growth rates.
Also impressive in the analysis of the
Jorgenson data is the degree to which the varying
experiences of U.S. manufacturing in different
decades derives from different degrees
of bad experience (real cost increases) rather
than different degrees of good experience (real
cost reduction). It is as if the creative part of
Schumpeter's "creative destruction" was
more steady (for these decades in U.S. manufacturing)
than the destructive part, whetting
our (or at least my) appetite to look deeper,
inquiring into why this was so.
The Mexican data at the firm level were
somewhat more recalcitrant than the Jorgenson
data by industrial branch, but they nonetheless
give us a clear picture of lots of winners and
lots of losers, with the losers being strongly
characterized by falling real value added and/
or by falling real rates of return.4

in two ways-one using value added by
a set of firms on the one hand, and the other
using "output" by those same firms, measured
through dividing value added by separate
estimated firm-by-firm price (of value
added) indexes pj. For these purposes we can
conveniently think in terms of logarithms, so
let:

V = observed value added of firm;
pj = estimated firm-level price index;
y, = v, - p, = estimated output;
Vj = Tj + ej [Tj =true value added];
p= = 7rj + Uj [7r, = true price index]; and
qj = T- 7r, [true output of firm].
We would like to have data on cj and its
variance

2 2 +

If we simply work with observed value added
as our quantity variable, we get
a?2 = a2 + a? (assuming at0 = ?)
If we worked with the measured yj, we get
2= ao + a? + a2 + u2- 2at
(assuming a and e to be strictly random).
My presumptions are as follows:
(i) We can estimate value added quite accurately
at the firm level. Hence the presumption
that ao is small.

(ii) In most industries, there is considerable
variety among the firms and their products.
Hence, except in cases of industries
with very homogeneous products, we
should not expect a2 to be small. Hence,
I expect a > a?

(iii) Finally, we have the presumption that, at
least at the level of firms within an industry,
o7 < 0. We know that firms
choose to operate in regions of the demand
curve where they consider the elasticity
facing them to be greater than one.
But also, in an analysis of the growth
process, one would expect the big gains
in value added to accrue to those firms
in an industry which were passing along
to consumers some of the fruits of current
or past real cost reductions.
These three presumptions lead me to the conclusion
that ao is likely to understate the true
variance of output ao (because - 2JT > 0 and
ao2 > sa?), and that ao is likely to overstate
0o2 (only the covariance terms with e and u,
which were assumed to be zero, could make it
otherwise). And since Torre worked with real

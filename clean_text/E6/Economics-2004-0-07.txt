Despite the advantages of annuities, we see
only a small fraction of people doing voluntary
annuitization.14 Furthermore, those who do an-
nuitize make very odd choices. They buy nom-
inal annuities. There is wide popularity of what
are called guarantees-continued payments af-
ter death up to some limit.15 Such guarantees
undo some of the underlying annuitization, and
are a relatively expensive form of holding non-
annuitized wealth (given the relative adminis-
trative costs on annuities and other accounts).
They represent an increase in the riskiness of
one's bequest, not a decrease. That is, an annu-
ity without a guarantee costs less, allowing one
to leave one's heirs a determinate amount in
present value, rather than a random amount
depending on the date of death.'6 More gener-
ally, many features of insurance markets are
hard to reconcile with sensible decisions by
households and the equilibrium industry re-
sponse we would expect in the presence of
sensible demands. The extremely limited op-
tions available for annuitization seem to reflect
the natural response of the supply of insurance  to the nature of demand.17
Some have tried to explain this limited use of
annuities by the degree of annuitization that
already exists in government programs. But vol-
untary annuitization, while present for centuries
before the creation of these programs, was not
extensive in the population and is unlikely to
become extensive if the programs were re-
moved. Asymmetric information is another can-
didate for explaining this situation, and it does
cause an adverse selection effect on pricing that

would discourage some individuals from annu-
itizing. While large systematic differences in
life expectancy do exist, much of the difference
is readily attributed to easily measured factors,
so insurance companies could do more to over-
come this problem, given the potential for large
gains to the insured.18 In the United Kingdom,
there is a sizable market for individual purchase
of annuities because of a large tax incentive for
their purchase from assets in tax-favored indi-
vidual retirement accounts. In the presence of
this demand, suppliers are offering annuities
with better prices for those with "impaired
lives." We do not see this risk classification in
the United States, presumably because there is
not a ready market in which firms could take
advantage of selection by risk classification and
better pricing since so few households purchase
annuities on an individual (nongroup) basis. So,
adverse selection alone can not explain the low
level of annuitization that is present.'9
I believe the major issue behind this pattern
of insurance demand is the failure of many to
understand the advantages of annuitization.
This plausibly relates to the failure of much of
the population to understand the properties of
stochastic variables, as has been documented by
cognitive psychologists. It is to be expected that
the set of insurance products that are marketed
will reflect the shortcomings of consumer
understanding-it is very expensive to try to
sell a product the virtues of which potential
customers do not understand. I think that with-
out Social Security, inadequate annuitization
would be even more widespread than inade-
quate savings.
In any event, social security systems in ad-
vanced countries typically provide benefits as
annuities, annuities that are generally indexed to
prices or wages (or a combination). This is a
simple application of the view that in a manda-
tory program, individuals should be given what
we think they would want if they were well-

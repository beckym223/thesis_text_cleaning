nificantly positive slope-but cannot readily
account for changes in unemployment. Further-
more, it cannot be reconciled with the well-
known fact that rising unemployment is
accompanied by a fall, not by a rise in quits, nor
with the role played by temporary layoffs to
which Martin Feldstein has recently called
attention. Again, his competitive model of
the commodity market, accepted also in The
General Theorv, implies that changes in real
wages. adjusted for long-run productivity trend,
should be significantly negatively correlated
with cyclical changes in employment and output
and with changes in money wages. But as early
as 1938, John Dunlop showed that this conclu-
sion was rejected by some eighty years of British
experience and his results have received some
support in more recent tests of Ronald Bodkin
for the United States and Canada. Similar tests
of my own, using quarterly data, provide strik-
ing confirmation that for the last two decades
from the end of the Korean War until 1973, the
association of trend adjusted real compensa-
tions of the private nonfarm sector with either
employment or the change in nominal compen-
sation is prevailingly positive and very signifi-
cantly so.'
This evidence can, instead, be accounted for
by the oligopolistic pricing model-according
to which price is determined by long-run mini-
mum average cost up to a mark-up reflecting
entry-preventing considerations (see the author,
1958) coupled with some lags in the adjust-
ment of prices to costs. This model implies that
firms respond to a change in demand by endeav-
oring to adjust output and employment, without
significant changes in prices relative to wages;
and the resulting changes in available jobs have
their initial impact not on wages but rather on
unemployment by way of layoffs and recalls and
through changes in the level of vacancies, and
hence on the length of average search time.
If, in the process, vacancies rise above a criti-
cal level, or "natural rate," firms will endeavor
to reduce them by outbidding each other, thereby
raising the rate of change of wages. Thus, as
long as jobs and vacancies remain above, and
unemployment remains below, some critical
level which might be labeled the "noninflation-
ary rate" (see the author and Lucas Papademos,
1975), wages and prices will tend to accelerate.
If, on the other hand, jobs fall below, and unem-
ployment rises above, the noninflationary rate,
firms finding that vacancies are less than optimal
-in the limit the unemployed queuing outside
the gate will fill them instantly will have an
incentive to reduce their relative wage offer. But
in this case, in which too much labor is looking
for too few jobs, the trend toward a sustained
decline in the rate of growth of wages is likely
to be even weaker than the corresponding accel-
eration when too many jobs are bidding for too
few people. The main reason is the nonhomo-
geneity of labor. By far the largest and more
valuable source of labor supply to a firm consists
of those already employed who are not readily
interchangeable with the unemployed and, in
contrast with them, are concerned with protec-
ting their earnings and not with reestablishing
full employment. For these reasons, and because
the first to quit are likely to be the best workers, a
reduction of the labor force can, within limits, be
accomplished more economically, not by re-
ducing wages to generate enough quits, but by
firing or, when possible, by layoffs which insure
access to a trained labor force when demand
recovers. More generally, the inducement to

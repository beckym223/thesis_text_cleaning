does. It tells the young and susceptible
and the old and vulnerable that economic
life has no content of power and politics
because the firm is safely subordinate to
the market and to the state and for this
reason it is safely at the command of the
consumer and citizen. Such an economics
is not neutral. It is the influential and invaluable
ally of those whose exercise of
power depends on an acquiescent public.
If the state is the executive committee of
the great corporation and the planning
system, it is partly because neoclassical
economics is its instrument for neutralizing
suspicion that this is so. I have spoken
of the emancipation of the state from economic
interest. For the economist there
can be no doubt as to where this task begins.
It is with the emancipation of economic
belief.

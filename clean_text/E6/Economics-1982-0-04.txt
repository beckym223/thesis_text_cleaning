We, no less than other writers, owe a heavy
debt to predecessors from Bertrand to Bain,
from Cournot to Demsetz. Nevertheless, it
must surely be acknowledged that the follow-
ing characterization of the general tenor of
the literature as it appeared until fairly re-
cently is essentially accurate.
First, in the received analysis perfect com-
petition serves as the one standard of wel-
fare- maximizing structure and behavior.
There is no similar form corresponding to
industries in which efficiency calls for a very
limited number of firms (though the earlier
writings on workable competition did move
in that direction in a manner less formal
than ours).
Our analysis, in contrast, provides a gener-
alization of the concept of the perfectly com-
petitive market, one which we call a "per-
fectly contestable market." It is, generally,
characterized by optimal behavior and yet
applies to the full range of industry struc-
tures including even monopoly and oligop-
oly. In saying this, it must be made clear that
perfectly contestable markets do not popu-
late the world of reality any more than per-
fectly competitive markets do, though there
are a number of industries which un-
doubtedly approximate contestability even if
they are far from perfectly competitive. In
our analysis, perfect contestability, then,
serves not primarily as a description of real-
ity, but as a benchmark for desirable
industrial organization which is far more
flexible and is applicable far more widely
than the one that was available to us before.
Second, in the standard analysis (including
that of many of our fellow rebels), the prop-
erties of oligopoly models are heavily depen-
dent on the assumed expectations and reac-
tion patterns characterizing the firms that
are involved. When there is a change in the
assumed nature of these expectations or re-
actions, the implied behavior of the oligopo-
listic industry may change drastically.
In our analysis, in the limiting case of
perfect contestability, oligopolistic structure
and behavior are freed entirely from their
previous dependence on the conjectural vari-
ations of incumbents and, instead, these are
generally determined uniquely and, in a
manner that is tractable analytically, by the
pressures of potential competition to which
Bain directed our attention so tellingly.
Third, the standard analysis leaves us with
the impression that there is a rough con-
tinuum, in terms of desirability of industry
performance, ranging from unregulated pure
monopoly as the pessimal arrangement to
perfect competition as the ideal, with relative
efficiency in resource allocation increasing
monotonically as the number of firms ex-
pands.
I will show that, in contrast, in perfect-
ly contestable markets behavior is sharply
discontinuous in its welfare attributes. A
contestable monopoly offers us some pre-
sumption, but no guarantee, of behavior con-
sistent with a second best optimum, subject
to the constraint that the firm be viable
financially despite the presence of scale
economies which render marginal cost pric-
ing financially infeasible. That is, a contest-
able monopoly has some reason to adopt the
Ramsey optimal price-output vector, but it
may have other choices open to it. (For the
analysis of contestable monopoly, see my
article with Elizabeth Bailey and Willig, Pan-
zar and Willig's article, and my book with
Panzar and Willig, chs. 7 and 8.)
But once each product obtains a second
producer, that is, once we enter the domain
of duopoly or oligopoly for each and every
good, such choice disappears. The contest-
able oligopoly which achieves an equilibrium
that immunizes it from the incursions of
entrants has only one pricing option-it must
set its price exactly equal to marginal cost
and do all of the things required for a first
best optimum! In short, once we leave the
world of pure or partial monopoly, any con-
testable market must behave ideally in every
respect. Optimality is not approached gradu-
ally as the number of firms supplying a
commodity grows. As has long been sug-
gested in Chicago, two firms can be enough
to guarantee optimality (see, for example,
Eugene Fama and Arthur Laffer).
Thus, the analysis extends enormously the
domain in which the invisible hand holds
sway. In a perfectly contestable world, it
seems to rule almost everywhere. Lest this

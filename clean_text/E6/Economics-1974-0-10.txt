true neoclassical spirit is being denied in
such a model. Although we are not usually
explicit about it, we really postulate that
when a market could be created, it will be.
I sometimes think that welfare economics
ought to be considered an empirical dis-
cipline. Implicitly, if an opportunity for a
Pareto improvement exists, then there will
be an effort to achieve it though some so-
cial device or another. In our theories and
to a considerable extent in practice, the
cheapest way in many cases is the creation
of a market; and markets do emerge. If a
market is impractical for one or another of
the reasons we usually call "market fail-
ure," then very likely some other social
device will at least be tried: government
intervention; codes of professional ethics;
or economic organizations with some
power intermediate between the competi-
tive firm and the government.
Thus, the failure of markets for future
goods must be regarded as an analytic
problem as well as a presupposition. It
seems to me there are two basic causal fac-
tors. One is that contracts are not enforce-
able without cost and forward contracts
are more costly to enforce than contem-
poraneous contracts; the other is that be-
cause of the many uncertainties about the
future, neither buyers nor sellers are will-
ing to make commitments which com-
pletely define their future actions. Let me
take these two points up in turn.
The ability to make enforceable con-
tracts is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for a market. However, there is
no way to insure complete enforceability.
An individual may make a contract which
he cannot in fact fulfill. Penalties may in-
deed be imposed on failure to live up to
one's agreement, but they are not a sub-
stitute for compliance from the viewpoint
of the other party, and there is always a
degree of cost in enforcing the penalties.
The laws of bankruptcy are a social recog-
nition that complete enforceability is im-
possible and that it is even socially desir-
able to set limits on the penalties for
failure. However, when the exchange of
values for values is simultaneous or nearly
so, the contracts may almost be self-
enforcing. If a good has been sold and not
paid for, it can be recovered; if there is a
continuing relation of buyer and seller, a
failure to settle bills can be met by refusal
to make further deliveries, in which case
the loss is minimized. With contracts ex-
tending into the distant future, on the
contrary, the possibility of failure to com-
ply becomes greater, partly because the
self-enforcement aspects become weaker,
partly because unexpected changes may
intervene to make even a sincerely in-
tended compliance difficult or impossible.
The outstanding examples of forward
contracts are credit instruments. The
buyer, who is taking the risks of default, is
motivated to protect himself by seeking
more information about the seller. The
lender wants to know the borrower's as-
sets, the prospects for changes in them,
possibly even what he is going to do with
the money. This very individualized in-
formation-seeking relation is quite far
from the arm's length impersonal model of
a market. The so-called capital markets
are in many structural aspects very differ-
ent from our model markets. It is of
course an empirical question how far their
behavior departs from the model. But
the recurrent theme of credit rationing and
availability doctrines, the essential imper-
fections of the credit market which un-
derlie monetarist theories of cyclical fluc-
tuations suggest that the incomplete en-
forceability of credit contracts and the
protective steps taken by lenders are sig-
nificant factors in explaining the working
of the market.
While the enforceability question ex-
plains why those forward contacts that are
made do not constitute a perfect market,
we need more to understand why even

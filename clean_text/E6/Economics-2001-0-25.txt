10. The IT products contribute 0.50 percentage
points to TFP growth for 1995-1999, compared to
0.25 percentage points for 1990-1995. This reflects
the accelerating decline in relative price
changes resulting from shortening the product cycle
for semiconductors.

F. Output Growth

This subsection presents the sources of GDP
growth for the entire period 1948 to 1999. Capital
services contribute 1.70 percentage points,
labor services 1.14 percentage points, and TFP
growth only 0.61 percentage points. Input
growth is the source of nearly 82.3 percent of
U.S. growth over the past half century, while
TFP has accounted for 17.7 percent. Figure
11 shows the relatively modest contributions of
TFP in all subperiods.

More than three-quarters of the contribution
of capital reflects the accumulation of capital
stock, while improvement in the quality of capital
accounts for about one-quarter. Similarly,
increased labor hours account for 80 percent of
labor's contribution; the remainder is due to
improvements in labor quality. Substitutions
among capital and labor inputs in response to
price changes are essential components of the
sources of economic growth.
A look at the U.S. economy before and after
1973 reveals familiar features of the historical
record. After strong output and TFP growth in
the 1950's, 1960's, and early 1970's, the U.S.
economy slowed markedly through 1990, with
output growth falling from 3.99 percent to 2.86
percent and TFP growth declining from 0.92
percent to 0.25 percent. Growth in capital inputs
also slowed from 4.64 percent for 1948-1973 to
3.57 percent for 1973-1990. This contributed to
sluggish ALP growth-2.82 percent for 1948-
1973 and 1.26 percent for 1973-1990.
Relative to the early 1990's, output growth increased
by 1.72 percent in 1995-1999. The contribution
of IT production almost doubled, relative
to 1990-1995, but still accounted for only 28.9
percent of the increased growth of output. Although
the contribution of IT has increased
steadily throughout the period 1948-1999, there
has been a sharp response to the acceleration in the
IT price decline in 1995. Nonetheless, more than
70 percent of the increased output growth can be
attributed to non-IT products.
Between 1990-1995 and 1995-1999 the contribution
of capital input jumped by 0.95

cline in the patents per R&D ratio in the
United States (and also in most of the other
countries for which we have data). This
raised the specter of diminishing returns to
R&D and offered the hypothesis of "exhaustion
of inventive opportunities" as a
potential explanation for the productivity
slowdown.
This hypothesis has been examined recently
by various authors. There are basically
two styles of analysis: one focuses directly
on the link, if any, between R&D and
productivity growth (see e.g., Griliches,
1986a; Bronwyn Hall, 1993; Scherer, 1993),
while the other uses patents as indicators of
the output of the R&D effort and looks at
what has happened to the "knowledgeproduction
function" (see e.g., Griliches,
1990; Ricardo Caballero and Adam Jaffe,
1993; Robert Evenson, 1993; Samuel
Kortum, 1993). The bridge that is missing
between these two approaches would examine
the units in which patents affect productivity
growth and ask whether they have
stayed constant over time. Without such
constancy, no clear interpretation is possible.

II. Productivity Growth and the Role of R&D
In parallel to the aggregate "residual"
literature, a more micro-oriented approach
had developed. It took the study of technical
change, diffusion, and the role of formal
R&D as its main challenge, with the hope
of bringing more of it within the realm of
economic analysis, helping thereby also to
explain some of this residual away. Using
modern language, one can interpret Edwin
Mansfield's and my own early work on diffusion
and on the role of R&D in agriculture
and manufacturing as trying to endogenize
as much of technical change as was
possible (Griliches, 1957, 1958, 1964;
Mansfield, 1961, 1965). Other important
contributors to this literature were Richard
Nelson, Scherer, Jacob Schmookler, and
Nestor Terleckyj. By expanding the notion
of capital to include also R&D capital and
estimating its effects, this literature documented
the contribution of public and private
investments in R&D and their spillovers
to the growth of productivity.4 But the magnitude
of the estimated effects was modest,
not enough to account for the bulk of the
observed residual or the fluctuations in it
(Griliches, 1988). The experience here was
similar to other attempts to account for the
residual, such as using "embodiment" theories
to magnify the potential effects of capital
accumulation (Denison, 1962; Nelson,
1962) or looking for increasing returns to
scale (Griliches and Vidar Ringstad, 1972).
These various effects are real and nonnegligible,
but not large enough.
There is one other way of trying to make
something more out of the R&D story: the
possibility that the productivity impact of
R&D has declined over time-that the coefficients
have changed. This hypothesis has
been investigated repeatedly by a number of
researchers with mixed results. Studies that
used data through the 1970's and early
1980's found no decline in the relevant coefficients.
More recent studies that analyze
data through the late 1980's report more
mixed results, varying strongly with how the
computer industry and its deflator are handled
in the analysis.5 At the same time, the
stock market's valuation of R&D fell significantly,
both in terms of ex post returns to

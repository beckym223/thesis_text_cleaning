rate each year to produce enough revenues to
cover expenditures for given values of
points.71 Both types of adjustment need a
small buffer stock of assets (or borrowing
ability) because of lags between setting benefit
or tax rules and the determination of actual
expenditures and revenues.72
U.S. Social Security uses price and wage
indexing in the determination of both benefits
and the payroll tax base.73 This reliance on
automatic adjustments decreases the frequency
of the need for legislation.74 One popular proposal
is to extend automatic adjustments to include
an adjustment for life expectancy. Such a
change would play two roles-one is to have an
automatic adjustment rather than legislating in
anticipation of or in response to life expectancy
changes. The other is to decrease the actuarial
imbalance in a way that may be easier politically
than comparable direct changes.
But what mix of benefit and revenue changes
is the best response to
nce the sizes of the groups
Part of an approach to this question is to ask
how individual lifetime plans should vary with
life expectancy. This depends on how the potential
earnings trajectory and the difficulty
(disutility) of work change along with life expectancy.
If both opportunities and difficulties
in a year depended on the proportional position
of that year relative to life expectancy (and
mortality rates also depended on relative age),
then all of an optimal individual adjustment
would come in working longer. That is, optimal
work would be a fixed fraction of life expectancy.
The change in Social Security with the
same pattern has all of the adjustment in lower
benefits for each age of retirement.
However, I suspect that the proportional case
assumes too large a change in both earnings
opportunities and difficulty in work relative to
life expectancy. If the optimal outcome for an
individual were to work a smaller percentage of
life expectancy, then a sensible approach would
spread the implied drop in lifetime consumption
over both pre- and postretirement years. Decreased
preretirement consumption corresponds
to an increase in the Social Security tax rate. In
historic data, where the steady growth in life
expectancy has been accompanied by a steady
growth in real earnings, we have a steady decline
in the percentage of life expectancy
worked. This suggests a mix of tax and benefit
changes since we do expect a continued correlation
between life expectancies and earnings
levels.76 I also believe that, at least among academic
economists, the life cycle of productivity
relates to more than just health and it is
unclear how such other factors are correlated
with life expectancy. I think an automatic adjustment
for life expectancy that included adjustment
in both benefits and tax rates would be
a good idea.

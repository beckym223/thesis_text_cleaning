A. Positive Questions:
4 The high cost of health care in the United States makes U.S. firms 9** 17** 64
substantially less competitive in the global economy.
9 Third-party payment results in patients using services whose costs 84** 93** 73*
exceed their benefits, and this excess of costs over benefits
amounts to at least 5 percent of total health care expenditures.
10 Physicians have the power to influence their patients' utilization 68* 77** 67
of services (i.e., shift the demand curve), and their propensity
to induce utilization varies inversely with the level of demand.
12 Widespread use of currently available screening and other 11** 83** 37
diagnostic techniques would result in a significant (more than
3%) reduction in health care expenditures (from what they
would otherwise be) 5 years from now.
13 The primary reason for the increase in the health sector's share of 81** 37 68*
GDP over the past 30 years is technological change in
medicine.
18 Differential access to medical care across socioeconomic groups 0** 17** 34*
is the primary reason for differential health status among these
groups.
19 In the long run employers bear the primary burden of their 13** 8** 43
contributions to employees' health insurance.
B. Policy-Value Questions:
National health insurance questions:
3 The U.S. should now enact some plan that covers the entire 62 65* 68*
population.
7 The U.S. should seek universal coverage through a broad-based 54 56 56
tax with implicit subsidies for the poor and the sick.
14 The U.S. should seek universal coverage through mandates, with 38 29* 46
explicit subsidies for the poor and the sick.
15 Given a choice between the Clinton health care plan or no federal 36 33* 28**
health care legislation for at least 5 years, the Clinton plan
should be approved.
Insurance company underwriting questions:
8 Insurance companies should be required to cover all applicants 51 29** 69*
regardless of health condition and not allowed to charge sicker
individuals higher premiums.
17 Health insurance premiums should be higher for smokers than for 71** 90** 85**
nonsmokers.
20 Health insurance premiums charged to individuals born with 14** 20** 13**
genetic defects (that result in above average use of medical
care) should be higher than those charged to individuals
without such defects.
All other policy-value questions:
I It is inequitable for the govemment to vary subsidies for health 62 36 86**
insurance by size of firm.
2 "Any willing provider" legislation (that requires health plans to 12** 12** 39
include any physician who wants to be included) is desirable
for society as-a whole.
5 National standardized health insurance benefit packages should be 42 51 63
established.
6 It is inefficient for the govemment to vary subsidies for health 66* 42 73*
insurance by size of firm.
11 Expenditures on medical R&D are greater than is socially 27* 29* 16**
optimal.
16 All health insurance plans should be required to offer "point of 30** 55 83**
service" options (that allow patients to obtain care outside the
basic plan at additional cost).

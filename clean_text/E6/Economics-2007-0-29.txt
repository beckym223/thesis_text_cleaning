should behave. There is systematic reason why
such knowledge and experience are likely to be
accurate: by their nature, norms are generated
and known by a whole community. They are
known to those who abide by them, and those
who observe them as well.
We have shown ways in which macroeconomic
variables will be affected by norms. The neutralities
say that consumption should have no special
dependence on current income; investment should
be independent of current cash flow; wages and
prices should not depend on nominal considerations.
The very construction of those neutralities
denies the possibility that peoples' decisions
might be influenced by their views regarding how
they, and how others, should behave. In practice,
however, the neutralities are systematically violated.
Insofar as economists have felt it necessary
to explain these violations, they have appealed to
a variety of different frictions, such as myopia and
credit constraint. In so doing, they have failed to
consider that those violations would occur even in
the absence of those frictions: they will occur
because of decision makers' norms.
The incorporation of norms based on careful
observation imparts an appropriate balance to
macroeconomics. The New Classical research
program was correct in viewing models of the
early Keynesians as too primitive. They had not
been sufficiently attentive to the role of human
intent in choices regarding consumption, investment,
wages, and prices. But that research program
itself has failed to appreciate the extent to
which the Keynesians' views of macroeconomics
were also reflective of reality, since they
were based on experience and observation.
A macroeconomics with norms in decision
makers' objective functions combines the best
features of the two approaches. It allows for
observations regarding how people think they
should behave. It also takes due account of the
purposefulness of human decisions.

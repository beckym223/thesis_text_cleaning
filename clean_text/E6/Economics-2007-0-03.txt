Macroeconomics changed between the early
1960s and the late 1970s. The macroeconomics
of the early 1960s was avowedly Keynesian.
This was manifested in the textbooks of the
time, which showed a remarkable unity from
the introductory through the graduate levels.'
John Maynard Keynes appeared, posthumously,
on the cover of Time.2 Even Milton Friedman
was famously-although perhaps misleadinglyquoted:
"We are all Keynesians now."3 A little
more than a decade later Robert Lucas and
Thomas Sargent (1979) had published "After
Keynesian Macroeconomics." The love-fest was
over.

The decline of the old-style Keynesian economics
was due in part to the simultaneous rise
in inflation and unemployment in the late 1960s
and early 1970s. That occurrence was impossible
to reconcile with the simple nonaccelerationist
Phillips curves of the time.
But Keynesian economics also declined because
of a change in economic methodology.
The Keynesians had emphasized the dependence
of consumption on disposable income
and, similarly, of investment on current profits
and current cash flow.4 They posited a
Phillips curve, where nominal-rather than
real-wage inflation depended upon the unemployment
rate, which was used as an indication
of the looseness of the labor market.
They based these functions on their own introspection
regarding how the various actors
in the economy would behave. They also
brought some discipline into their judgments
by estimating statistical relations.5
But a new school of thought, based on classical

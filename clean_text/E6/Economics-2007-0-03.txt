Macroeconomics changed between the early
1960s and the late 1970s. The macroeconomics
of the early 1960s was avowedly Keynesian.
This was manifested in the textbooks of the
time, which showed a remarkable unity from
the introductory through the graduate levels.'
John Maynard Keynes appeared, posthumously,  on the cover of Time.2 Even Milton Friedman
was famously-although perhaps misleadingly-
quoted: "We are all Keynesians now."3 A little
more than a decade later Robert Lucas and
Thomas Sargent (1979) had published "After
Keynesian Macroeconomics." The love-fest was
over.
The decline of the old-style Keynesian eco-
nomics was due in part to the simultaneous rise
in inflation and unemployment in the late 1960s
and early 1970s. That occurrence was impossi-
ble to reconcile with the simple nonaccelera-
tionist Phillips curves of the time.
But Keynesian economics also declined be-
cause of a change in economic methodology.
The Keynesians had emphasized the depen-
dence of consumption on disposable income
and, similarly, of investment on current prof-
its and current cash flow.4 They posited a
Phillips curve, where nominal-rather than
real-wage inflation depended upon the un-
employment rate, which was used as an indi-
cation of the looseness of the labor market.
They based these functions on their own in-
trospection regarding how the various actors
in the economy would behave. They also
brought some discipline into their judgments
by estimating statistical relations.5
But a new school of thought, based on clas-

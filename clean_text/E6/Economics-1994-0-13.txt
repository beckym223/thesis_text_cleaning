An example of the consequences of this
shift is what has come to be known as the
"computer paradox." We have made major
investments in computers and in other
information-processing equipment. The
share of "information" equipment in total
producer investment in durable equipment,
in current prices, has more than doubled,
from about 17 percent in 1960 to 36 percent
in 1992. Computers alone went up from less
than 1 percent to 11 percent of the total;
and that does not allow for improvements in
the quality of this equipment, which has
been happening at a very fast rate-on the
order of 15-30 percent per year (see Jack
Triplett, 1989; Berndt and Griliches, 1993).
Why has this not translated itself into visible
productivity gains? The major answer to
this puzzle is very simple: over threequarters
of this investment has gone into
our "unmeasurable" sectors (see Table 3),
and thus its productivity effects, which are
likely to be quite real, are largely invisible in
the data.
That there were gains is not really in
doubt. Just observing the changes in the
way banks and airlines operate, and in the
ways in which information is delivered to
firms and consumers, would lead one to
conclude that we are in the midst of a major
technical revolution. Effective distances are
declining rapidly in many parts of the world.
The rise of ATM networks in banking has
resulted in substantial though largely unmeasured
time savings for consumers. It is
less clear, however, whether the large expansion
of the securities industry has been
associated with a similar productivity increase
or was primarily a response to a real
decline in the cost of rent-seeking induced
by the falling price of informationprocessing
(see Timothy Bresnahan et al.,
1992).
There is also some scattered evidence for
the positive contribution of computers in
manufacturing, but given the needle-in-the
haystack aspect of this problem, it is not
particularly strong (see e.g., Alan Krueger,
dustries produce largely intermediate products and services.
But personal consumption expenditures account
only for about 68 percent of GDP, while services
represent 56 percent of personal consumption. Thus, it
is unlikely that looking at consumption data in more
detail would change the tenor of my remarks much. A
cursory look at Personal Consumption Expenditures
(Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1990) yields a rough
estimate of 47 percent of total consumption expenditures
not easily measurable in real terms. The two
largest difficult items consist of hard-to-measure services
in the medical, insurance, legal, entertainment,
and education areas (23 percent) and housing-related
services (21 percent).

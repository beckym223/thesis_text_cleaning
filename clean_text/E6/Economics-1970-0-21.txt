percent for the other unrecorded costs,
thus obtaining a charge corresponding to
14 percent of private GNP. But it will
prove to be important to take a look also
at the progress-yields obtained on this
immoderate assumption. I will build on
the fact that the 14 percent charge is ex-
cessive by a significant margin.
VI. Levels and Trends of "Objective" Yields
and Observations on Matters Calling
for Subjective Appraisal
The method by which the quantitative
yield-appraisals were obtained is based
on the discussion in Sections III and V
and the details are explained in the foot-
note below.40 Note that on the productiv-
ity-side we rely on Kendrick's estimate of
annual productivity-increase including the
effect of intergroup shifts (2.8 percent),
but the reader can convince himself that
the result would be influenced little by
the use of estimates that exclude the in-
tersector effect (for the most recent period
this would have been an increase of 2.6
percent p.a.). To me it seems reasonable to
relate also the intersector effect to prog-
ress-generating inputs.41
Many statements one would like to be
able to make about these results would be
much too risky for presentation. But there
are two statements which I consider to be
safe.
The first of these is that the present
average social rate of return from the
progress-activities is substantially in ex-
cess of 13 percent on the all-inclusive
cost-base, and substantially in excess of
18 percent on the cost-base limited to
institutionally profit-oriented progress-in-
puts ("reduced" cost-base). The rates of
13 percent and of 18 percent would imply
charging all capital consumption to prog-
ress, as if extension of service-life were
entirely costless ad infinitum except for
continued maintenance costs at the now
usual level. If we charged one-fourth of the
capital consumption to progress, and made
a moderate charge also for other unre-
corded costs, we would obtain a 31 percent
rate of return on the all-inclusive cost-base,
and a 55 percent rate on the reduced cost-
base. These particular charges rest on
0 (a) 1966, all-inclusive cost-base, 4 percent of private
GNP charged for unrecorded costs. Recorded total R&D,
as a proportion of private GNP: 3.3 percent (all other
data will also be expressed in relation to this output
measure). Cost of increased per capita education: 0.5
percent. Annual rate of productivity-increase: 2.8 per-
cent, which becomes reduced to 2.4 percent when the
bulk of the foregoing education item is deducted (see
Section IV, 1). Since 3.8+4.0=7.8, and since 2.4 *. 7.8
=0.31, the resulting rate of return is 31 percent. For
1966 this rate and that presented in (c) below, bound
the range defined in Section II when the charge is
4 percent.  (b) Same as (a) except with the clearly excessive charge
of 14 percent instead of 4 percent (see last paragraph of
Section V). The resulting rate of return is 13 percent.
For 1966 this rate and that presented in (d) bound the
range defined in Section II when the charge is 14  percent.  (c) 1966, reduced cost-base, with 4 percent charge. We
enter 1.1 percent for the recorded R &D. Since 1.1+4.0
=5.1, and since 2.8-5.1=0.55, the resulting rate of
return is 55 percent. See last sentence in (a).
(d) Same as (c) except wtth 14 percent charge. The
resulting rate is 18 percent. See the last sentence in (b).  (e) 1953, all inclusive cost-base, with 4 percent charge.
Recorded total R &D: 1.6 percent. Cost of increased
per capita education: 0.3 percent. Productivity-increase
2.8 percent which becomes reduced to 2.55 percent
when the bulk of the foregoing education item is de-
ducted. Since 1.9+4=5.9, and since 2.55?.5.9=0.43,
the resulting rate of return is 43 percent. For 1953 this
rate and that presented in (g) bound the range defined
in Section II when the charge is 4 percent.
(f) Same as (e), except with 14 percent charge. The re-
sulting rate of return is 16 percent. For 1953 this rate
and that presented in (h) bound the range defined in
Section II when the charge is 14 percent.  (g) 1953, reduced cost-base, uwth 4 percent charge. The
resulting rate of return is 60 percent. See last sentence
in (e).
(h) Same as (g), except with 14 percent charge. The re-
sulting rate of return is 19 percent. See last sentence
in (f).
The lowest rate in this listing is that in (b) above. As
for the "corresponding" rate obtained in the alternative
framework outlined at the outset of Section III, see fn. 21.
41 By using the 2.6 percent figure we would reduce the
lowest of the rates listed in the preceding footnote (i.e.,
the rate there presented in paragraph (b)) from 13 per-
cent to 12 percent.

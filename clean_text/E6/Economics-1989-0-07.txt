expenditures, a major adjustment is immedi-
ately in order, consistent with the practice of
private business, to exclude the capital ex-
penditures and include in current outlays
only depreciation charges. Second, just as
not all of nominal interest receipts should be
included in income, not all of government
nominal interest payments should be counted
in outlays. Rather these should be adjusted
for the changing real value of government
debt, due both to inflation itself and the
changing market price of securities associ-
ated with changing interest rates, which latter
may relate in part to changing rates of infla-
tion. We should in effect be including in
government revenues the inflation tax on the
private holders of government securities or
the money backed by central bank holdings
of those securities, or including in outlays
only real interest payments.'0
These two adjustments, for capital expen-
ditures and for inflation, make such a huge
difference in the Federal government budget
as to wipe out the much decried "budget
deficit."" The first of them has an identical
effect in raising our measure of national sav-
ing, greatly depressed in its conventional
measure by the negative contribution of the
presumed fiscal dis-saving."
Gross saving is identically equal to gross
private domestic investment plus net foreign
investment. The supposed "twin deficit" in
the U.S. balance of trade or, more exactly,
the current account,"3 is the other side of the
coin of negative foreign investment, that is,
net acquisition by foreigners of claims on the
United States or its residents. If we measure
those claims incorrectly and hence measure
net foreign investment incorrectly, we corre-
spondingly mis-measure gross saving. By un-
derstating gains in the value of our claims on
foreign assets, we understate business and,
to a certain extent, personal income and
saving.
But here again there is a major difference,
not noted by the public and politicians and,
I must add, not noted by most economists
either, between the official measures and
those that would correspond to meaningful
economic theory.'4 Particularly, direct in-
vestment by U.S. firms abroad and by for-
eign firms in the United States are both
taken at original cost. There is then no ad-
justment for the changes in value of the
resulting assets in their own currencies or,
taking into account changing exchange rates,
the value of those changes in dollars.
Saving should correspond to increases in
wealth. National saving should correspond
to increases in national claims to wealth, at
home and abroad, net of increasing foreign
claims to domestic wealth. But to be mean-
ingful, these should surely relate to claims
measured in real, current, or market value.
In fact, they do not. Because they do not, we
have been confronted with repeated asser-
tions that the United States has become " the
world's greatest debtor nation," which is

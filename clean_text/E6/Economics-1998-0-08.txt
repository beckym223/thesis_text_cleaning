to 170 percent of the RCR for total manufacturing.
In 1975-1980 this figure was about 240
percent, in 1980-1985 only about half that, and
in 1985-1991 a little more than 125 percent.
The trouble is that when the aggregate TFP contribution
is relatively small, the cumulative total
of the positive contributions is a large multiple
of that aggregate, while when the aggregate is
large, this multiple tends to be smaller. Thus, for
1970-1975 and for 1975-1980, the total RCR
in manufacturing as a whole was only about 2.3
percent of initial manufacturing value added. In
contrast, the total RCR for all manufacturing was
almost 10 percent of initial manufacturing value
added in 1980-1985, and about 7.5 percent in
1985-1991.
The problem obviously becomes greatly compounded
if the real cost reduction for the aggregate
(in this case total manufacturing) turns out
to be negative. Special conventions would have
to be established to make clear the interpretation
of Loreinz-like diagrams in such cases.
I believe I have hit on a felicitous way of
solving all these problems, and at the same
time creating an even better, clearer visual representation
of the degree of concentration or
dispersion of real cost reduction among the
components of an aggregate. The idea is simply
to relabel the vertical axis of the Lorenzlike
diagram, making it represent an annual
growth rate. For simplicity, think of a 30-
degree line as representing 1 percent per annum
of TFP growth. The rest of the vertical
axis would be calibrated accordingly. Thus, by
looking at the slope of a simple chord, we
could visually assess how rapid was the TFP
growth of the aggregate in question.

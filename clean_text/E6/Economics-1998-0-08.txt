to 170 percent of the RCR for total manufactur-
ing. In 1975-1980 this figure was about 240
percent, in 1980-1985 only about half that, and
in 1985-1991 a little more than 125 percent.
The trouble is that when the aggregate TFP con-
tribution is relatively small, the cumulative total
of the positive contributions is a large multiple
of that aggregate, while when the aggregate is
large, this multiple tends to be smaller. Thus, for
1970-1975 and for 1975-1980, the total RCR
in manufacturing as a whole was only about 2.3
percent of initial manufacturing value added. In
contrast, the total RCR for all manufacturing was
almost 10 percent of initial manufacturing value
added in 1980-1985, and about 7.5 percent in
1985-1991.
The problem obviously becomes greatly com-
pounded if the real cost reduction for the aggre-
gate (in this case total manufacturing) turns out
to be negative. Special conventions would have
to be established to make clear the interpretation
of Loreinz-like diagrams in such cases.
I believe I have hit on a felicitous way of
solving all these problems, and at the same
time creating an even better, clearer visual rep-
resentation of the degree of concentration or
dispersion of real cost reduction among the
components of an aggregate. The idea is sim-
ply to relabel the vertical axis of the Lorenz-
like diagram, making it represent an annual
growth rate. For simplicity, think of a 30-
degree line as representing 1 percent per an-
num of TFP growth. The rest of the vertical
axis would be calibrated accordingly. Thus, by
looking at the slope of a simple chord, we
could visually assess how rapid was the TFP
growth of the aggregate in question.

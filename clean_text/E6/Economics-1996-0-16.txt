eliminating premium differentials. Or, it may
reflect a reluctance to choose between conflicting
values.

Before leaving the survey it is worth considering
what it reveals about the ability of
health economists to disseminate their conclusions
about the positive questions to a wider
audience. Overall, one must conclude that they
have not been very successful, as revealed by
the political debate of 1993- 1994 and the media
coverage of policy issues. Consider, for
example, question 19 concerning whether in
the long run employers bear the primary burden
of their contributions to their employees'
health insurance. Although 87 percent of the
health economists disagreed with that statement,
politicians on both sides of the debate
assumed, erroneously, that it was correct.
Moreover, nearly all of the media made the
same error. Most of the politicians and most
of the media also showed little understanding
of questions 4, 12, 13, and 18.
I am as ready as the next economist to
criticize politicians and journalists, but the
survey results suggest that their poor understanding
of health economics is not entirely
their fault. First, the economic theorists
and the practicing physicians, two groups with
above-average ability and opportunity to absorb
the conclusions of the health economists,
did not show good command of the positive
questions. In my judgment the health economists
answered 80 percent correctly, but the
average theorist answered only 52 percent correctly
and the mean score for the physicians
was only 53 percent. The differences in the
distributions of scores is striking: 45 of the
46 health economists had more correct answers
than the average theorist or the average
physician.

A second possible reason for the poor understanding
of health economics displayed by
the politicians and the media in 1993-1994 is
the wide disagreement among health economists
over the policy-value questions. When
health economists interact with politicians and
journalists, their discussions probably focus on
the policy-value questions; in the absence of a
professional consensus on many of these questions,
it is not surprising that politicians and
journalists fall back on their own values to
shape their positions.

Returning to the question posed at the beginning
of this section about why economic
research failed to result in a more informed
and productive health care policy debate, the
survey results provide some provisional answers.
First, although health economists are
in substantial agreement about the positive
questions, they have major disagreements
about policy-value questions. Second, health
economists were not successful in getting
their conclusions on positive questions accepted
by the politicians or the media, and
even had difficulty in communicating their
results to economic theorists and practicing
physicians. Third, the health economists'
disagreements over policy probably reflect
differences in values, although it is clear that
there are many positive questions embedded
in the policy-value questions. In my judgment
the problem is not so much that the
health economists disagree about the embedded
questions as that they are uncertain
about them. In the face of such uncertainty,
they tend to let their values drive their policy
recommendations.

III. The Future

If values play such an important role in policy
disputes, what are the implications for
economics and economists? First, we should
endeavor to make explicit the differences in
values, and seek ways to resolve them. Value
differences can take many different forms.
Economists are most familiar with the distinction
between efficiency and distributional issues,
especially greater equality of income
versus greater total income.40 But comprehensive
changes in health policy can have other
important distributional effects. Even for individuals
at the same income level, the costs
and the benefits of care could change along
many dimensions: rural areas versus central
cities, the elderly versus the young, smokers
versus nonsmokers, savers versus nonsavers,
men versus women, and so on. Health economists
who are unanimous in approving gains
in efficiency might have very different views

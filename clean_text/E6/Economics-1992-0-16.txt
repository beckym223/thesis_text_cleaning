(local construction, etc.) in which the technology
is embedded. The difference in cost
is at least an order of magnitude. While the
developed countries are feeling their way
into some common attack on their own carbon
emissions, a tangible expression of their
interest and an effective first step would be
to establish a permanent means of funding
technical aid and technology transfer for
developing countries, as well as research,
development, and demonstration in
carbon-saving technologies suitable to those
countries. Eventually the rural Chinese
household may cook more efficiently with
nuclear-powered electricity, but for another
generation or two what is important is less
carbon-wasteful ways of cooking and heating.


Maybe there is a role here for the carbon
tax. Western Europe, North America, and
Japan will be burning 3 or 4 billion tons of
carbon per year for the next decade. Taxing
themselves, that is, contributing in proportion
to the carbon they consume, at one,
two, or three dollars per ton, they could
contribute to a fund that might begin at $3
billion per year and grow to $10 billion. The
carbon tax is a little arbitrary here, and a
U.S. administration may be wary about a
precedent that carries over when the tax
rises an order of magnitude, but compared
with alternative criteria for sharing costs it
might not even be a bad precedent.

(local construction, etc.) in which the tech-
nology is embedded. The difference in cost
is at least an order of magnitude. While the
developed countries are feeling their way
into some common attack on their own car-
bon emissions, a tangible expression of their
interest and an effective first step would be
to establish a permanent means of funding
technical aid and technology transfer for
developing countries, as well as research,
development, and demonstration in
carbon-saving technologies suitable to those
countries. Eventually the rural Chinese
household may cook more efficiently with
nuclear-powered electricity, but for another
generation or two what is important is less
carbon-wasteful ways of cooking and heat-
ing.
Maybe there is a role here for the carbon
tax. Western Europe, North America, and
Japan will be burning 3 or 4 billion tons of
carbon per year for the next decade. Taxing
themselves, that is, contributing in propor-
tion to the carbon they consume, at one,
two, or three dollars per ton, they could
contribute to a fund that might begin at $3
billion per year and grow to $10 billion. The
carbon tax is a little arbitrary here, and a
U.S. administration may be wary about a
precedent that carries over when the tax
rises an order of magnitude, but compared
with alternative criteria for sharing costs it
might not even be a bad precedent.

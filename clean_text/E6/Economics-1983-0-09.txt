Under circumstances in which uncertainty
is overpowering, as Keynes suggested was
often the case for stock prices, a price may
remain approximately stable for a considerable
time on the basis of a tacit "convention,
" which market participants come to
accept. The convention amounts to the assumption
that

... the existing state of affairs will continue
indefinitely, except in so far as
we have specific reasons to expect a
change... For, if there exist organized
investment markets,... an investor can
legitimately encourage himself with the
idea that the only risk he runs is that of
a genuine change in the news over the
near future, as to the likelihood of which
he can attempt to form his own judgment,
and which is unlikely to be very
large. For, assuming that the convention
holds good, it is only these changes
which can affect the value of his investment,
and he need not lose his sleep
merely because he has not any notion
of what his investment will be worth
ten years hence.

Thus, the price of gold might well, for a
considerable period of time, fluctuate narrowly
around a level far from the equilibrium
price at which amounts produced
and consumed would in the long run be
equal. And so, although to a considerably
lesser extent, could the price of wheat or tin.
Yet such a period of approximate stability
might at any time be upset by a major,
self-maintaining movement in either direction.


IV. Macroeconomic Inventory Theory
Let us now turn to some of the macroeconomic
implications of this microeconomic
theory of commodity prices and inventories.
First, and most important, is to recognize
that there is nothing in standard price theory-
even when we expand it to take account
of speculative demands for inventories, price
bubbles, or of the possible transmission of
speculative fever from one market to another-
that implies that the aggregate stock
of inventories, and the rate of aggregate
inventory accumulation for an entire economy
should exhibit any systematic variation
over time. Random disturbances to supply
and/or demand for particular commodities
or products might lead to periods of net
accumulation or net decumulation of inventories
of those products. But the aggregation
of many time-series, each subject to random,
non-serially-correlated variation, produces
only a time-series with proportionally smaller
variation. Thus, several years of systematic
general accumulation of inventories, followed
by substantial periods of general
decumulation of inventories, finds no basis
in conventional price theory.
Yet one of the most obvious macroeconomic
facts of life is the existence of pronounced
cycles, both in the size of aggregate
inventories and in their rate of accumulation.
Indeed, of all of the conventional subaggregates
of real national product, the one that
shows the greatest decrease (not merely in
percentage but in aggregate dollar amount)
between periods of business expansion and
of business contraction is, almost invariably,
that of the net addition to business inventories.
This total typically goes from a large
positive amount at business cycle peaks to
a large negative amount at business cycle
troughs. This difference exceeds the typical
cyclical decline in business investment in
plant and equipment, in residential construction,
in purchases by consumers or governments,
or in net exports. The existence of
these pronounced cycles in aggregate inventory
accumulation has long challenged macroeconomists
to develop theories that might
explain this phenomenon. The response to
this challenge has produced a second and
macroeconomic literature about inventories,
that is almost completely nonintersecting
with microeconomic price theory.
In this macroeconomic inventory literature,
prices and price expectations are rarely

plot (the last couple of decades) we see a
more or less continuous decline with a small,
but possibly significant, turnaround in the
late 1980's. Similar trends can be seen also
in other countries, even in Japan (Evenson,
1991). But before one takes this as an indi-
cator of our recent problems, one should
glance also at the left side of this figure,
which goes back to the early 1920's. How
long has this been going on? This ratio
keeps falling, both through good times
(while productivity growth rates were rising)
and bad times. If this was not a cause for
worry earlier, why should one worry about it
now?9
III. Patents: A Shrinking Yardstick?
To decide whether we should be worried
by what is happening with the patent num-
bers we need to know what they measure.
Since I have discussed this at some length
elsewhere (Griliches, 1990), I will make only
two points here. First, the interpretation of
Figure 4 need not be pessimistic. Its mes-
sage may not be what meets the eye. And,
second, the meaning of both the numerator
and the denominators of the ratios plotted
in Figure 4 may have changed significantly
over time.
If patents can be taken as indicators of
invention, and if the value of an invention is
proportional to the size of its market (or
economy), then the fact that their total
numbers remained roughly constant over
long time periods is consistent with nonde-
clining growth rates of output and overall
productivity.10 If inventions are "produced"
by a combination of current R&D and the
existing state of knowledge (incorporating
the accumulated effects of science and
spillovers from the previous research activi-
ties of others), and if R&D is invested ap-
proximately "optimally," then under rea-
sonable assumptions, a rise (or fall) in the
underlying knowledge stock will affect them
both in parallel fashion and will leave their
ratio unchanged.1" There will be, therefore,
no evidence in this ratio on the underlying
state of the "stock of knowledge." More-
over, it will be declining with growth in the
size of the market, since a rise in the value
of inventions will push R&D up until pres-
ent costs equal again the present value of
future (private) returns.
The rate of growth of domestic patents
was close to zero during the last three
decades. That by itself should not be worri-
some. If their average value had been grow-
ing at the same rate as the economy as a
whole, there would be no reason for us to
worry about it. But there were long periods
when the actual numbers were worse than
that. During 1965-1985 the number of do-
mestic patent applications declined by - 0.6
percent per year while company-financed
R&D expenditures were growing by 4.8 per-
cent per year, in constant prices. But a
negative growth rate in the number of in-
ventions and a positive one in R&D are
inconsistent with an unchanging inventions
production function, unless the overall pool
of available knowledge is declining, or more

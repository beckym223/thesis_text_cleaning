value of output, and in the United States
this is practically the same thing as to say
that we are concerned here with a Residual
observed as a proportion of the privately
produced output.22 The procedure has the
implication that the analysis of the determinants
of technological progress is as
yet in a tentative stage, so that if for example
R & D, the increase of per capita
education, the extra-inputs needed for
industrial changeovers, and some other
items to be discussed in this paper make up
the identifiable progress-inputs (as I
suggest they do), we cannot at present
expect good results from regressing output
on all these specific inputs along with the
conventional inputs specified in the production
functions. I feel convinced that
realism does require recognizing this limitation
but that this does not mean that we
are left with no good argument for relating
the Residual to the inputs and costs I
defined as progress-generating.
Regression analysis of cross-sections of
individual industry groups and of firms
enabled investigators to obtain confirmation
of the hypothesis that productivityincreases,
as estimated by the method of
the Residual, are positively correlated with
R & D-intensity.23 On the other hand,
spillover effects from the public into the
private sector, the diffusion of knowledge
within the private sector, and the narrowness
of the concept of R & D-intensity
as compared to our concept of progressgenerating
input make it desirable to ask
the question of the relationship of the
Residual to progress-inputs also in broader
intertemporal terms. When the question is
so posed, it calls for exploring whether the
time-sequence of productivity increases, as
measured by the Residual, bears an understandable
relation to the time-sequence
of progress-generating inputs. We shall see
that this is indeed the case, but in such
work there is at present only limited room
for regression analysis and for "testing" in
the technical sense. This is because for
some purposes for which time-sequence
comparisons of productivity increase with
inputs are used it is advisable to rely on a
rather small number of typical values of
the variables for successive periods of
considerable duration; high serial correlation
and lags reduce the usefulness of data
reflecting yearly changes.24 Emphasis will

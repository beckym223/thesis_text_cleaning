second is the extent to which additional work,
and so additional payroll taxes, increase the
measure of lifetime earnings and so add to  benefits.
For an average worker at ages 62 and 63,
Social Security had a roughly zero marginal tax
for the average worker when the age for full
benefits was 65.49 With the increase in the age
for full benefits there will be a small tax at these
ages. While implicit taxes used to be much
larger above the age for full benefits, the retirement
test has been eliminated for those ages.
With differences in life expectancy, a zero tax
on an average worker implies that some workers
are taxed and some are subsidized by the pres-  ence of the retirement test.50
The retirement test has two effects. One is to
raise (delayed) monthly benefits for those continuing
to work. To the extent that a worker
would have consumed out of benefits received
while still working, the delay in the start of
benefits raises later consumption (for both the
worker and possibly a surviving spouse) since
more is saved. This is advantageous to the extent
that consumption falls too much after retirement.
51 The combination of a delay and
increase in benefits is also redistribution across
workers based on life expectancy along the lines
discussed above. On the other hand, benefit
ineligibility while continuing to work discourages
work for those not fully valuing their increased
later benefits and those with shorter life
expectancy. Empirical estimates find that the
overall labor supply effect is modest, suggesting
that the increase in monthly benefits effect is
more important. The retirement test also helps

with the risk in earnings trajectories that comes
from how opportunities to earn (and disutilities)
develop toward the end of a career. The retirement
test addresses that risk to the extent that
there is taxation on continued work and those
continuing to work are less needy on average
than those who stop working earlier.52 Thus I
conclude that the retirement test does distort
labor supply, but that distortion is more than
offset by the gains from improved lifetime consumption
allocations and increased insurance.
Limiting the range of ages at which the retirement
test applies makes sense. Otherwise
some of those working to very advanced ages
would have replacement rates above 100 percent
and, if liquidity-constrained, would prefer
to have part of benefits while still working.
Currently the age for the end of the retirement
test is the age for full benefits. I am not aware of
any analysis of the optimal choice of an age for
the end of the retirement test.
B. Labor Supply at Younger Ages
I have focused on the retirement decision
since elasticities here are larger than those with
earlier labor supply decisions. But younger
workers pay payroll taxes and anticipate an
increase in benefits once they retire as a consequence
of the earnings that were subject to tax.
The effect on labor supply is relevant for choosing
the size of a mandatory retirement income
system. This incentive depends on the perceived
link between taxed earnings and retirement (and
disability) benefits. While those nearing retirement
age often gather information on the workings
of the system and seek advice on the
advantages of different timing of retirement,
younger workers are not well informed.53 Some

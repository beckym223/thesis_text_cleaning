ly mentioned. This second literature deals
primarily with work-in-process and manufac-
tured product inventories, including inven-
tories held by wholesalers and retailers-
although it may also embrace commodity
inventories held by manufacturers or proces-
sors (but not by producers and dealers). The
earliest versions of this literature described
inventories as being held, increased, or re-
duced as the result of production or ordering
decisions that were based upon expectations
of future changes in quantities produced or
demanded-expectations generated mainly
by recently experienced levels of production
or sales. It purported to describe the determi-
nants, for example, of the desired and actual
stocks of coal and iron ore held by steel
mills; of the desired and actual inventories of
finished steel held by mills, steel warehouses,
or steel-using manufacturers; of the desired
and actual inventories of automobiles held
by producers and dealers; and of the desired
stocks and actual stocks of steel bedsprings
held by department stores. In early versions
of this macroeconomic literature, inventory
decisions were shown to be capable of hav-
ing highly destabilizing macroeconomic ef-
fects-particularly when expectations of fu-
ture sales were modelled as responsive in
particular ways to experienced levels and
changes of sales, while production responded
to orders and expected sales.9
This literature, of course, belongs to a
universe of discourse in which prices (includ-
ing wage rates) do not clear markets continu-
ously, but rather adjust slowly to evidence of
gaps between amounts supplied and de-
manded. Or they may be "administered" on
the basis of working rules of thumb based
mainly on costs or on other prices. In this
universe of discourse, such pricing rules are
not necessarily irrational, given the limited
extent of knowledge, and the experience of
past instability. And, since prices so estab-
lished do not typically cause production and
consumption to move quickly into approxi-
mate equality, market participants do not
expect that prices will so move, and therefore
they do not so move. Rather, production and
sales are brought toward equality primarily
by changes-delayed changes-in planned
rates of production or purchase, that reflect
observed or expected changes in quantities
consumed or used in production, and that
are designed to restore or to maintain effi-
cient levels of inventories. Indeed, microeco-
nomic theories of rational quantity adjust-
ments to unplanned differences between
production and sales began to be developed
in the early 1950's, and have increasingly
supplied a formal basis for macroeconomic
inventory theory.'0 These fluctuations in
quantities produced or purchased may lead,
in the face of relatively inflexible prices and
wages, to further self-reinforcing changes in
production, purchases, and employment-
self-reinforcing through income effects on
consumption and "accelerator" effects on in-
vestment: perhaps dampened by interest rate
effects on investment, to the extent that the
supply of money does not accommodate
changes in the demand for it.
Indeed, if such patterns of quantity re-
sponses at the level of the firm to unplanned
changes in inventories become standard-
ized-because such patterns do, in time, re-
verse imbalances between production and
sales-it may become entirely rational to
expect such patterns of quantity movements
to occur at a macroeconomic level. Rational
expectations based on such "theories" could
then lead to inventory, production, and
purchase decisions that help to perpetuate the
macroeconomic instability of production, con-
sumption, and inventories.
Persistent and massive macroeconomic in-
ventory cycles deny either the existence of
rational expectations, or, more plausibly, the
ability of such expectations to stabilize out-
put and employment. As the persistence of
such cycles comes to be expected, and their
amplitude to be accepted, it is not surprising
that full flexibility of prices comes to be seen

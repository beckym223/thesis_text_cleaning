mentioned. This second literature deals
primarily with work-in-process and manufactured
product inventories, including inventories
held by wholesalers and retailersalthough
it may also embrace commodity
inventories held by manufacturers or processors
(but not by producers and dealers). The
earliest versions of this literature described
inventories as being held, increased, or reduced
as the result of production or ordering
decisions that were based upon expectations
of future changes in quantities produced or
demanded-expectations generated mainly
by recently experienced levels of production
or sales. It purported to describe the determinants,
for example, of the desired and actual
stocks of coal and iron ore held by steel
mills; of the desired and actual inventories of
finished steel held by mills, steel warehouses,
or steel-using manufacturers; of the desired
and actual inventories of automobiles held
by producers and dealers; and of the desired
stocks and actual stocks of steel bedsprings
held by department stores. In early versions
of this macroeconomic literature, inventory
decisions were shown to be capable of having
highly destabilizing macroeconomic effects-
particularly when expectations of future
sales were modelled as responsive in
particular ways to experienced levels and
changes of sales, while production responded
to orders and expected sales.9
This literature, of course, belongs to a
universe of discourse in which prices (including
wage rates) do not clear markets continuously,
but rather adjust slowly to evidence of
gaps between amounts supplied and demanded.
Or they may be "administered" on
the basis of working rules of thumb based
mainly on costs or on other prices. In this
universe of discourse, such pricing rules are
not necessarily irrational, given the limited
extent of knowledge, and the experience of
past instability. And, since prices so established
do not typically cause production and
consumption to move quickly into approximate
equality, market participants do not
expect that prices will so move, and therefore
they do not so move. Rather, production and
sales are brought toward equality primarily
by changes-delayed changes-in planned
rates of production or purchase, that reflect
observed or expected changes in quantities
consumed or used in production, and that
are designed to restore or to maintain efficient
levels of inventories. Indeed, microeconomic
theories of rational quantity adjustments
to unplanned differences between
production and sales began to be developed
in the early 1950's, and have increasingly
supplied a formal basis for macroeconomic
inventory theory.'0 These fluctuations in
quantities produced or purchased may lead,
in the face of relatively inflexible prices and
wages, to further self-reinforcing changes in
production, purchases, and employmentself-
reinforcing through income effects on
consumption and "accelerator" effects on investment:
perhaps dampened by interest rate
effects on investment, to the extent that the
supply of money does not accommodate
changes in the demand for it.
Indeed, if such patterns of quantity responses
at the level of the firm to unplanned
changes in inventories become standardized-
because such patterns do, in time, reverse
imbalances between production and
sales-it may become entirely rational to
expect such patterns of quantity movements
to occur at a macroeconomic level. Rational
expectations based on such "theories" could
then lead to inventory, production, and
purchase decisions that help to perpetuate the
macroeconomic instability of production, consumption,
and inventories.

Persistent and massive macroeconomic inventory
cycles deny either the existence of
rational expectations, or, more plausibly, the
ability of such expectations to stabilize output
and employment. As the persistence of
such cycles comes to be expected, and their
amplitude to be accepted, it is not surprising
that full flexibility of prices comes to be seen

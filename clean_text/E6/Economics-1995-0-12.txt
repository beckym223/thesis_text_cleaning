In examining social decision mechanisms,
we have to take the Arrow conditions seriously,
but not as inescapable commandments.
Our intuitions vary on these matters,
and Arrow's own theorem shows that not
everything that appeals to us initially would
really be simultaneously sustainable. There
is a need for some de-escalation in the grim
"fight for basic principles." The issue is not
the likely absence of rationally defendable
procedures for social decisions, but the relative
importance of disparate considerations
that pull us in different directions in evaluating
diverse procedures. We are not at the
edge of a precipice, trying to determine
whether it is at all "possible" for us to hang
on.

VI. Procedures and Consequences
I turn now to the general issue, identified
earlier, of the contrast between relying respectively
on (i) the "rightness" of procedures,
and (ii) the "goodness" of outcomes.
Social choice theory, in its traditional
form, would seem to belong to the latter
part of the dichotomy, with the states of
affairs judged first (the subject matter of
"social preference" or "social welfare
judgements"), followed by identification of
procedures that generate the "best" or
"maximal" or "satisficing" states. There are
two issues here. First, can consequences
really be judged adequately without any notion
of the process through which they are
brought about? I shall also presently question
whether this presumption of processindependence
is the right way of seeing the
claims of social choice theory. Second, can
we do the converse of this, and judge procedures
adequately in a consequence-independent
way? This issue I take up first.
Sugden (1981, 1986), who has extensively
analyzed this dichotomy (between procedural
and consequence-based views), explains
that in the public choice approach, which he
supports, "the primary role of the government
is not to maximize the social good, but
rather to maintain a framework of rules
within which individuals are left free to
pursue their own ends" (Sugden, 1993
p. 1948). This is indeed so, but even in
judging a "framework of rules" in this way,
we do need some consequential analysis,
dealing with the effectiveness of these
frameworks in letting individuals be actually
"free to pursue their own ends." In an
interdependent world, examples of permissive
rules that fail to generate the freedom
to pursue the respective individual ends are
not hard to find (see Sen, 1982b).
Indeed, it is not easy to believe that the
public-choice approach is-or can bereally
consequence-independent. For example,
Buchanan's support of market systems
is based on a reading of the consequences
that the market mechanism tends to produce,
and consequences certainly do enter
substantially in Buchanan's evaluation of
procedures: "To the extent that voluntary
exchange among persons is valued positively
while coercion is valued negatively, there
emerges the implication that substitution of
the former for the latter is desired, on the
presumption, of course, that such substitution
is technologically feasible and is not
prohibitively costly in resources" (Buchanan,
1986 p. 22). While this is not in serious
conflict with Buchanan's rejection of any
"transcendental" evaluation of the outcomes
(p. 22), nevertheless the assessment
of outcomes must, in some form, enter this
evaluative exercise. 32

There are, however, other-more purely
procedural-systems to be found in this literature.
If the utilitarian tradition of judging
everything by the consequent utilities is
one extreme in the contrast (focusing only
on a limited class of consequences), Nozick's
(1974) elegant exploration of libertarian
"entitlement theory" comes close to the
other end (focusing on the right rules that
cover personal liberties as well as rights of
holding, using, exchanging, and bequeathing

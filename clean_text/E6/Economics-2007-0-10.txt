constraints on the consumption of parents (so they
do not leave bequests); (k) myopia of the parents
regarding children's future tax payments.29
The preceding list gives empirical reasons for
failure of Ricardian equivalence; but, lengthy as
it is, it still ignores its theoretical challenge.
According to that challenge, under economists'
standard assumptions, with perfect certainty and
with perfect foresight, Ricardian equivalence
will occur. Such a result had previously been
unsuspected by economists.30
Two possible conclusions can be drawn from
this surprise. On the one hand, we might con-
tinue to assume that classical assumptions de-
scribe economic behavior. The five neutralities
that are the subject of this paper concern the
realignment to macroeconomics that occurred
as economists gained understanding of the con-
sequences of classical assumptions from the
mid-1950s to the mid-1970s.
Economists may have been correct in draw-
ing the conclusion that the early Keynesian eco-
nomics was too simplistic and naive. But they
could have drawn another conclusion from this
surprise. In this view, Ricardian equivalence is
a telltale: we do not believe, even in the pres-
ence of perfect foresight and perfect certainty,  that the parent will make an equal and opposite
offset of her social security transfer in terms of
an increased bequest to her child. Something
must be missing from the motivation in Barro's
model; otherwise, it would not have given rise
to results that are so surprising.
B. Douglas Bernheim and Kyle Bagwell
(1988) give further evidence suggesting that
Ricardian equivalence is such a telltale. They
show how the same logic would apply to a
network of gift-givers. Remarkably, any
member of such a network will be indifferent
whether she receives an extra dollar or any
other participant in the network is the recip-
ient. Such conclusions, suspect as they are,
suggest a problem with the model beyond the
lack of realism involved in perfect foresight
and perfect certainty. They also suggest miss-
ing motivation.
James Andreoni (1989) has put his finger on
what that missing motivation might be.31 A
bequest is a type of gift. The parent will receive
utility from giving such a gift. Ricardian equiv-
alence will fail if the parent has utility from
gift-giving. With a social security transfer, more
money is hers, and the same consumption allo-
cation to herself entails a greater gift to her
child. With declining marginal utility for bequest-
giving, she will then divide an increased social
security transfer between additional consumption
for herself and an additional bequest to her child.32
Andreoni thus describes the utility missing
from the standard utility function as that arising
from the "warm glow" from giving. Such a
characterization may be accurate. It also sounds
as if it is very close to classical assumptions-
that there is nothing fundamentally different
about this additional motivation. But this seg-
ment of the utility function is, in fact, very
different from economists' usual characteriza-
tion of motivation. We know that the "warm
glow" does not come from the utility the parent

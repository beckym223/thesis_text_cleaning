ticular attention and has led to consideration of
the impact on national capital.
A. Transfers by Cohort
Everyone is aware of the decision to pay
earlier cohorts of retirees benefits far larger than
could have been financed by the taxes they paid
and the interest that could have been earned on
them. Figure 1, an updating to 2002 dollars of
analysis done by Dean R. Leimer (1994), shows
the lifetime transfers by cohort (left scale) and
the cumulative net payments by cohort (right
scale) for cohorts born through 1949, and so

turning 55 this year.56 The aggregate net trans-
fers to these cohorts is roughly $11.5 trillion.
How much did this early generosity reduce
national capital? We have some estimates but
they are surely not reliable. A believable time-
series econometric study is probably not doable
and there is no consensus that one has been
done satisfactorily. Another approach would be
by simulation. But a credible simulation re-
quires modeling the appropriate underlying
behavior-the extent to which different workers
would save on their own without such a pro-
gram. Surely, a simulation with all workers
being fully rational lifetime utility maximizers
has no credibility. And we would also need to
track the effects on national savings from Social

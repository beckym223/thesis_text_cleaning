rapid expansion of government social welfare
and civil rights programs which began
in the mid-1960's and which developed and
matured in the 1970's. Expenditures for "social
welfare," which were 9 percent of GNP
in 1950 and only 10 percent in 1960, rose to
15 percent in 1970 and to 20 percent in
1977.6 The other was "explosion" of public
regulatory legislation and administration directed
to the protection of the environment,
and to the safety of workers and consumers.7
The new legislation became the basis for
strong, privately organized campaigns to
limit growth and the application of new
technology.
IV
The maturing of the Great Society programs
in the spheres of welfare and civil
rights, and the implementation and expansion
of the social regulatory laws, brought
our mixed economy to a new stage of development.
There was a new distribution of
emphasis among the different dimensions of
economic welfare, and correspondingly a
new distribution of economic power between
the private and public spheres. The
new development of the mixed economy,
however, is now confronted by a changed
and less-favorable growth environment.
Looking back, we can now see that a
slower rate of productivity growth accompanied
the institution and the maturing of the
Great Society programs. To what extent the
two developments were associated as effect
and cause, however, is still an open question.
So is a related matter; that is, the
responsibility of transient as distinct from
durable factors for bringing about the
slowdown we observe. It would be wrong to
pretend that there are now definite answers
to these questions. The factual position,
however, deserves description because it
bears on the origins of our present discontents.

Beginning in the late 1960's, private-sector
productivity growth fell back from the high
speed it had reached in the years preceding.
The retardation before 1973 was moderate.
The new pace approximated that during the
somewhat slack later 1950's. After 1973,
however, the slowdown became much more
serious. The upshot is that average productivity
growth for the fourteen years between
1965 and 1979 ran at only one-half the pace
of the years from 1948 to 1965; since 1973,
it has risen at less than one-fifth that earlier
pace.8 The extent of the slowdown between
the two rough halves of the postwar period,
before and after 1965-to say nothing of
the post-1973 period by itself-may be
judged from the fact that the post-1965 productivity
slowdown has been more severe
than any of the retardations measured across
major depressions going back to the 1890's.
That includes the retardation from the 1920's
to the 1930's.9 Yet, up to 1979 we had had
no major depression.
In my judgment, the productivity retardation,
at least since 1973, has been accompanied
by a slower rate of improvement in
material conditions of well-being. In some
respects, and by some measures, there have
even been significant declines. It is true that,
because the labor force was rising rapidly in
relation to population, the growth rate of
real disposable income per capita was well
maintained-at least if we depend on the
deflator for "personal consumption expenditures"
; not if we use the CPI. As perceived
by many people, however, the welfare sig-
6See U.S. Social Secuxity Administration. Social
welfare expenditures cover social insurance, public
assistance, health and medical care, veterans' programs,
education, housing and "other." At present, exhaustive
expenditures accdunt for nearly half and transfer
programs for somewhat more than half of total welfare
expenditures. (See Sheldon Danziger, Robert
Haveman, and Robert Plotnick, pp. 6-8.) The major
reasons for the accelerated growth since 1965 appear to
lie in the initiation and expansion of new programs,
such as Medicare, and in the generous increase of
benefit schedules in old programs like Social Security
(see Plotnick, pp. 277-78).
7The Federal Register, which records new regulations,
contained 10,000 pages in 1953, but 65,000 pages
in 1977. The federal budget to administer regulatory
activities was $5 billion in 1978, having doubled since
1974. Compare Arthur Bums, p. 4.  8I depend for these comparisons on the easily accessible
Bureau of Labor Statistics figures for "output per
hour of all persons" in the private business sector. See
Economic Report of the President (1980, Table B-37).

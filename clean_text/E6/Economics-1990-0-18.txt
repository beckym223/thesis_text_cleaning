A comprehensive income tax along these
lines would permit further rate reductions
throughout the income scale if the degree of
progression enacted in 1986 were to be retained.
However, the progressivity of the
federal tax system has declined since the
mid-1970s, even after taking into account
the effect of the 1986 act. To restore the
degree of progressivity of the mid-1970s, the
rate of graduation of the tax rates would
need to be increased. I estimate that this can
be accomplished with a rate schedule ranging
from 4 percent at the bottom to 48
percent at the top of the taxable income
scale-a moderate schedule of rates by any
standard.

It is clear from this analysis that the revenue
potential of the income tax has not
been exhausted in this country. Even if the
base is not broadened, the income tax can be
used to raise considerable additional revenues
in order to eliminate the recurring
federal deficits. Each percentage-point increase
in the individual and corporate income
tax rates would bring in about $30
billion in 1994, so that three points would
come close to balancing the overall budget in
that year. A top individual income tax rate
of 31 percent and a corporate rate of 37
percent cannot be regarded as punitive or
harmful to economic incentives.
What is inappropriate in my view would
be to introduce a value-added tax, as some
are suggesting. The value-added tax is regressive
and imposes unnecessarily heavy
burdens on the lower income classes. With
tax rates as low as they are today, more
revenues should come from the income tax,
the tax paid by those who have the ability to
pay. In view of the recent reductions in the
progressivity of the federal tax system, it
would be unconscionable to enact the distinctly
inferior alternative of a value-added
tax.

111. Interdisciplinary Differences in Outlook
We have now assembled enough reference
material for us to make a start with our
main topic-the way in which differences in
outlook between the disciplines affect the
conduct and evaluation of joint studies.
The most significant difference between
economics and the natural sciences lies in
the opportunities for testing and verification
of hypotheses. Jacob Marschak used to say
that economists carry the combined bur-
dens of meteorologists and engineers. Like
the meteorologists, they are expected to pre-
dict the future course of important vari-
ables in their field of study. Just as engi-
neers design more and more efficient
machines, economists are also expected to
improve the design of society where it af-
fects good use of resources. But, like the
meteorologist, the economist has tradi-
tionally been confined to drawing inferences
from passive observations, records of data
generated by the turbulence of the at-
mosphere or the fluctuations and trends of
economic life. Finally-a very important
difference-meteorologists and engineers
have all the laws and measurements es-
tablished by physics and chemistry avail-
able to them, fully documented by experi-
mental tests and results.
Traditionally, economists have not
searched for similar inputs from experi-
mental or observational research of a
psychological or sociological nature. In the
1950's and early 1960's they have engaged
in some experimentation of their own on be-
havior under uncertainty and in bargaining
and gaming situations. However, the find-
ings of this work have not been put to use
as premises for modeling an entire economy.
For that purpose, over a few articulate pro-
tests, many economists have been satisfied
to postulate simple rules of behavior by
consumers and business firms. The terms
"introspection" and "casual empiricism"
have been used to describe the cognitive
sources of these premises. In the version of
the currently dominant "neoclassical"
school of thought, these premises express
optimizing responses of demand and supply
to a uniform price system: satisfaction
maximizing by consumers, profit maximiz-
ing by firms.
These premises have a certain intuitive
plausibility about them. Undoubtedly, their
widespread adoption has also been aided by
the richness of the body of inferences one
can draw from them. In fact, the premises
form the logical foundation for the paradigm
of neoclassical economics: the concept of an
equilibrium of prices and quantities that in
some way ties together the economic de-
cisions taken by all seemingly independent
agents. Conceptually the prices and the
quantity responses may describe a sta-
tionary state over an extended period of
time. More realistically, they may be dated
variables and thus also link decisions that
vary over successive periods, to sustain a
moving intertemporal equilibrium.
Parenthetically, use of the term equi-
librium does not imply an assumption that

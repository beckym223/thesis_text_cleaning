that in both cases the security services are
merely inputs which should not be taken to
change our measure of final product. With
the massive increases in expenditures for na-
tional defense in recent years-whether jus-
tifiable or not-the implications for our
measures of growth in GNP are substantial.5
II. Deficits and National Saving
and Investment
Substantial as are the differences between
income as usually measured and its theoreti-
cal construct, they are relatively small com-
pared to the departures of conventionally
measured saving and investment from their
theoretical counterparts.6 Personal saving,
the difference between disposable personal
income and outlays, of which the latter is
chiefly consumption, is immediately suspect
because of the measures of both income and
consumption, as is business or corporate sav-
ing because of questionable measures of
costs, investment, and profits.7 But the prob-
lem is much larger.
Investment is the acquisition or produc-
tion of capital, which in turn contributes to
current and future output. Should not the
production of new automobiles then qualify
as investment, whether they are bought by
business or by households or by govern-
ment? Should research expenses not be con-
sidered investment along with expenditures
for plant and equipment? Are the education
and training of our young not perhaps the
most important investment in future produc-
tivity that we can make?8 Yet we count such
private expenditures as consumption and the
vast if insufficient amount of output in the
form of public education is excluded from
investment under the apparently somewhat
pejorative heading of "government spend-
ing."
With gross income identically equal to
gross output, gross saving is identically equal
to gross investment, including increases in
net claims on the rest of the world, and net
saving is thus the claims on net additions to
capital. Saving should then include the por-
tion of income used to invest in the human
capital of a college education as well as the
portions used to buy corporate bonds or put
into a pension fund.
We have been bombarded for some time
with the arguments in political circles, but
also from many economists, utilizing data
from conventional measures and accounts,
that " national saving" is too low, disas-
trously low. This so-called national saving is
the sum of the personal and corporate sav-
ing, which we have had reason to question,
and government saving or the government
budget surplus.9 These measures are far from
the theoretical constructs to which we might
expect them to correspond.
First, since government budget surpluses
-or deficits-are taken as government re-
ceipts minus all government outlays, without
distinguishing between current and capital

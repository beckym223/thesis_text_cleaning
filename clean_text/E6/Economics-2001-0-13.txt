B. Capital Services

This subsection presents capital estimates for
the U.S. economy for the period 1948 to 1999.20
These begin with BEA investment data; the
perpetual inventory method generates estimates
of capital stocks and these are aggregated, using
service prices as weights. This approach, originated
by Jorgenson and Zvi Griliches (1996), is
based on the identification of service prices with
marginal products of different types of capital.
The service price estimates incorporate the cost
of capital.21

The cost of capital is an annualization factor
that transforms the price of an asset into the
price of the corresponding capital input.22 This
includes the nominal rate of return, the rate of
depreciation, and the rate of capital loss due to
declining prices. The cost of capital is an essential
concept for the economics of information
technology,23 due to the astonishing decline of
IT prices given in Table 1.
The cost of capital is important in many areas
of economics, especially in modeling producer
behavior, productivity measurement, and the
economics of taxation.24 Many of the important
issues in measuring the cost of capital have been
debated for decades. The first of these is incorporation
of the rate of decline of asset prices
into the cost of capital. The assumption of perfect
foresight or rational expectations quickly
emerged as the most appropriate formulation

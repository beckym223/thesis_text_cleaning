In sum, mandating benefits for the families of
workers is important, along with mandating
savings and mandating annuitization-the inclusion
of family benefits in Social Security
makes sense. There is good reason to think that
the current rules can be improved, but research
difficulties and political hurdles will need to be
overcome if we are to make improvements.
IV. Income Distribution, Insurance, and Labor
Supply38
In determining retirement benefits, Social Security
first averages the best 35 wage-indexed
annual earnings,39 then it uses a progressive
benefit formula to determine what real benefits
would be if first claimed at the age for full
benefits (commonly, if somewhat misleadingly,
called the normal retirement age),40 and then it
adjusts benefits for the age at which they start.
Moreover, between age 62 (the earliest age at
which retirement benefits can be claimed) and
the age for full benefits (which is in transition
from 65 to 67), benefits are only paid if earnings
are low enough, referred to as an earnings or
retirement test. Each of these steps in determining
benefits affects income distribution, insurance,
and labor supply. I will skip over
implications of using 35 years (as opposed to
more or fewer years or all of lifetime earnings
subject to tax)41 and of using a wage index to
weight the earnings in different years in determining
benefits (as opposed to using an
interest rate)42 and concentrate on the effects

of a progressive benefit formula and a retirement
test.43
Consider the stochastic process of earnings
opportunities. Individual workers face considerable
risks that are only partially correlated with
the economywide average earnings used in indexing.
Wages move differently by industry and
firm and region and some individuals have career
opportunities strongly affected by industry
and firm and region developments. We do not
have trading in the type of indexes Robert J.
Shiller (1993) has proposed in order to give
workers the ability to hedge these aspects of
their risks.44 Even if we managed to have trading
in such indices, it is beyond credibility that
most workers would take appropriate advantage
of these opportunities. When many workers can
not sort out the basics of portfolio diversification
in their 401(k)s, there is no reason to anticipate
successful execution of far more
complex financial strategies. By having replacement
rates that are higher for lower levels of
lifetime earnings, a social security system that

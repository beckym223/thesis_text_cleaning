as part of lifetime earnings insurance and redistribution,
to offset some of the redistributive
effects of uniform annuitization, and to address
the low antipoverty protection for the elderly
(SSI) in contrast with other advanced countries.
The retirement test at some ages makes sense.
Having redistributed to earlier cohorts,
spreading the implied cost over the indefinite
future (not fully funding Social Security) makes
sense and incomplete funding contributes to
risk sharing across cohorts. Relying on a mix of
a smaller mandatory system than is common in
Europe and voluntary private supplementation
makes sense, even though the voluntary system
is so incomplete in its coverage (and in need of
improved regulation). This is not to say there
are not other approaches that have led to systems
that function reasonably well. It is just to
say there is no need for radical reform in order
to have a good system-just a need to put the
program on a stronger financial footing while
improving the benefit structure at the same time.
I chose to write about why Social Security is
better than many people think rather than why
trying a radical reform would be worse than
many people think. A preference for a radical  reform can reflect different values and different
political predictions from mine. However, I
think that much of the apparent appeal of radical
reform lies in the implausible implicit assumption
that such a reform will pass into legislation
untouched by political hands, making for a
faulty comparison with the current system
which has flaws introduced and preserved by
the political system. A major reason for my
concern about radical reform is the potential for
ill-advised design, driven by political ideology
rather than a realistic assessment of likely outcomes.
A better goal than seeking radical reform
is trying to improve the highly satisfactory
current structure.

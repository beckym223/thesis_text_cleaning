tials than those we see between fast-growing
economies like Taiwan and mature economies
like the United States. This is the kind of evi-
dence that leads to the use of y values at or near
1 in applications.
But the CRRA model has problems. Rajnish
Mehra and Prescott (1985) showed that if one
wants to use a stochastic growth model with
CRRA preferences to account for the entire
return differential between stocks and bonds-
historically about 6 percent-as a premium for
risk, the parameter y must be enormous, per-
haps 50 or 100.11 Such values obviously cannot
be squared with (6). This "equity premium puz-
zle" remains unsolved, and has given rise to a
vast literature that is clearly closely related to
the question of assessing the costs of
instability.12
One response to the puzzle is to adopt a
three- rather than two-parameter description
of preferences. Larry G. Epstein and Stanley
E. Zin (1989, 1991) and Philippe Weil (1990)
proposed different forms of recursive utility,
preference families in which there is one pa-
rameter to determine intertemporal substitut-
ability and a second one to describe risk
aversion. The first corresponds to the param-
eter y in (6), and can be assigned a small
value to fit estimated average returns to cap-
ital. Then the risk-aversion parameter can be
chosen as large as necessary to account for
the equity premium.
Thomas D. Tallarini, Jr. (2000) uses prefer-
ences of the Epstein-Zin type, with an intertem-
poral substitution elasticity of 1, to construct a
real-business-cycle model of the U.S. economy.
He finds an astonishing separation of quantity
and asset price determination: The behavior of
aggregate quantities depends hardly at all on
attitudes toward risk, so the coefficient of risk
aversion is left free to account for the equity
premium perfectly.13 Tallarini estimates a wel-
fare cost of aggregate consumption risk of 10
percent of consumption, comparable to some

of the supply-side gains cited in Section I, and
two orders of magnitude larger than the estimate
I proposed in Section II.14 As Maurice Obstfeld
(1994) shows, this result is basically the for-
mula (4) with a coefficient of risk aversion two
orders of magnitude larger than the one I used.
Fernando Alvarez and Urban J. Jermann
(2000) take a nonparametric approach to the
evaluation of the potential gains from stabiliza-
tion policy, relating the marginal cost of busi-
ness-cycle risk to observed market prices
without ever committing to a utility function.
Their estimation procedure is based on the ob-
servation that consumption streams with a wide
variety of different risk characteristics-or
something very nearly equivalent to them-are
available for sale in securities markets. They
use a mix of asset-pricing theory and statistical
methods to infer the prices of a claim to the
actual, average consumption path and alterna-
tive consumption paths with some of the uncer-
tainty removed. They call the price differentials
so estimated marginal welfare costs, and show
that they will be upper bounds to the corre-
sponding total cost: my compensation parame-
ter A. The basic underlying hypotheses are that
asset markets are complete and that asset-price
differences reflect risk and timing differences
and nothing else.
The gain from the removal of all consump-
tion variability about trend, estimated in this
way, is large-around 30 percent of consump-
tion.15 This is a reflection of the high risk aver-
sion needed to match the 6-percent equity
premium, and can be compared to Tallarini's
estimate of 10 percent. But the gain from re-
moving risk at what Alvarez and Jermann call
business-cycle frequencies-cycles of eight

ponement of the onset of the yield of the
progress-generating activities.49 We will have
to accept this noncomparability. This differ-
ence is probably outweighed by another
difference which our lagless approach will at
first also neglect but for which we will have
to make crude allowances subsequently. I
mean the length of the gestation period
elapsing between some of the progress-
generating inputs and their industrial re-
sults, as compared to the shorter gestation
period for physical capital formation at a
given level of technological knowledge.
Our conclusions for the Cobb-Douglas
model are valid also in the CES framework,
provided we supplement the latter with a
distributive-shares equilibrium mechanism
and assume that the economy is moving in
the neighborhood of that equilibrium (with
pure labor-augmentation).50 In such a model,
given degrees of now achieved labor-aug-
mentation will in all future have to be
multiplied by the same weight to give the
proportionate rate of progress-generated net
addition to output, and hence the propor-
tionate output-increment will remain con-
stant, as a permanent flow. From here on-
i.e., concerning the comparison with phys-
ical investment-the reasoning is the same
as for the dynamic Cobb-Douglas model.
For the relationship between these models
and "reality," see my December 1967
article in this Review to which I referred in
Section I. See also Sections II and IV.

Explanation of Statements on
Input-Trends
1) The "Real-input" Versus the "Relative-
value" Component of the Rise of Recorded
R &- D.
In Section V it was said that from 1953 to
1966 total recorded R & D rose from $5.2
billions, the equivalent of 1.6 percent of
private GNP, to $22.2 billions, the equiv-
alent of 3.3 percent. The industry-financed
recorded R & D rose from $2.2 billions, the
equivalent of 0.7 percent of private GNP, to
$7.2 billions, the equivalent of 1.1 percent.
How large is the "real" component of this
increase?
A. One way of trying to answer this ques-
tion is to go through the following moves:
a) We note that from 1953 to 1966 the
number of R & D scientists and engineers,
expressed in "full-time equivalents," rose
about 2.3-fold (from about 225,000 to about
520,000), and we now assume that the total
real R & D input rose in the same propor-
tion;
b) since during this period real private
GNP (in 1958 prices) rose by 62 percent, we
consider that the "real" component of the
increase would have raised the ratio of total
R & D cost to private GNP by 42 percent of
the initial ratio (i.e., 230. 162=142);
c) since in fact this ratio rose not by 42
percent but by 111 percent (from 1.57 to
3.31 percent), the relative-valuation com-
ponent raised it by 49 percent of the initial
ratio;
d) since for the industry-financed R & D
the relative-valuation component was prob-
ably similar (49 percent), and since the
ratio of the industry-financed R & D to
private GNP actually rose by 60 percent
(from 0.67 to 1.07 percent), the "real" com-
ponent raised this ratio by merely 7 percent.
B. Another way of going about the matter
would be to use Helen Milton's index as if it
were an index of R & D input-prices-i.e.,
of cost of research per unit of R & D input in
general-though in reality it is an index of
cost of research per research worker (in-
cluding supporting personnel). Use of this
index requires a small amount of extrapola-
tion, because the index stops in 1965. How-
ever with reasonable extrapolation this pro-
cedure leads to the conclusion that the rela-
tive-valuation component was somewhat
larger than that estimated under A. The
Milton index points to a doubling of cost-of-
49 On the generous assumption of a 1 percent per
annum increase of the output-base as a specific result
of physical investment, and assuming a 10 percent dis-
count rate, this noncomparability is the equivalent of a
postponement of the onset of the yield of progress by
roughly one year.
50 In this framework the elasticity of substitution is
smaller than one and hence labor-augmenting innova-
tions are also labor-saving in Hicks's sense, though in
shares-equilibrium the process is Harrod-neutral.

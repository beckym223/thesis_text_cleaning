and prospectives that already has affected
many parts of microeconomics, especially
agricultural and labor economics, but also
the study of industrial organization and
preference theory. For example, the treatment
of marriage as a sorting of men and
women into small "partnerships" through a
reasonably efficient marriage market influenced
the analysis of how workers and
managers are allocated to different firms.
Viewing divorce as a joint decision by
husbands and wives based largely on information
gathered from living together encouraged
some studies of employment separations
to blur the analytical distinction
between quits and layoffs and to emphasize
the information about working conditions
and productivity gathered from on-the-job
experience.

The message of this address, however, is
not the importance of the family per se, even
though family welfare is the principal goal of
a well-run economic system. Nor that analytical
techniques developed to understand
family choices are valuable in other parts of
economics. The message is that family behavior
is active, not passive, and endogenous,
not exogenous. Families have large
effects on the economy, and evolution of the
economy greatly changes the structure and
decisions of families. I illustrated how families
and the economy interact through a discussion
of economic growth and other issues
in macroeconomics. A heightened awareness
of the interaction between economic change
and family choices will hasten the incorporation
of family life into the mainstream of
economics.

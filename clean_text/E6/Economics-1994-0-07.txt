Notes: The equations include also dlog(energy/capital) as an additional utilization
variable. Standard errors are shown in parentheses. The ratio of company-financed
R&D to total sales in 1974 is from Scherer (1984) for row 1; this ratio is updated for
1984 from National Science Foundation (1992) for rows 2 and 3. Row 3b shows
total-factor-productivity growth revised downward for computers and upward for
electronic components and drugs (computers = SIC 357).
R&D in the 1980's (Michael Jensen, 1993)
and the market's view of current R&D investments
(Bronwyn Hall and Robert Hall,
1993; B. Hall, 1993).
My own recent foray into this type of
analysis of industry data at the three-digit
SIC level is summarized in Table 1.6 It
reports estimates from regressions of growth
rates in total factor productivity (TFP)
on the rate of investment in R&D (the
R&D-sales ratio), where the estimated coefficient
can be interpreted as the excess
gross rate of return to R&D (Griliches,
1979). The earlier 1958-1973 period yields
an estimate on the order of 0.33, while the
estimate for the later 1973-1989 period even
rises a bit, to 0.36. So far, so good! But
when one excludes the outlier computer
industry (see Fig. 2) the estimated coefficient
falls from 0.36 to 0.13 for 1973-1989
and even lower for 1979-1989. Only one
observation out of 143 does this!7
These results raise a major data conundrum:
is it right to treat the computer inComputers

dustry as an outlier and exclude it from
such calculations just because the productivity
measure may be better there? It is quite
possible that if other technologically advanced
industries (such as instruments,
communications equipment, and pharmaceuticals)
had their price indexes adjusted
in a similar fashion, Figure 2 would look
much better, with the computer industry not
being as much of an outlier and with the
whole period showing much higher (social)
returns to R&D. That this is indeed the
case can be seen in Figure 3, where only
three such adjustments are made, but be-
6The total-factor-productivity numbers come from
the National Bureau of Economic Research data base
(Wayne Gray, 1992). The R&D numbers come from
Scherer (1984), updated to 1984 using 2.5-digit-level
information from National Science Foundation (1992).
'Updating the Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984) results
for 28 2.5-digit SIC industries and using a possibly
more appropriate R&D-by-product-field measure yields
essentially similar results, as does a parallel computation
at the more aggregated two-digit SIC level using
unpublished Bureau of Labor' Statistics data on total
(five-factor) productivity.

This is all the more interesting because in the
calculation of TFP a higher level of the rate of
return operates to reduce the calculated TFP
(i.e., Ap is a positive component of R' and
should presumably be positively correlated
with it,3 but R' is found by subtracting p AK
from Ay; hence, in a sense, the level of p
should presumably be negatively correlated
with R'). What we are seeing here, in my
opinion, is a genuine syndrome in which all
sorts of good things go together. Strong real

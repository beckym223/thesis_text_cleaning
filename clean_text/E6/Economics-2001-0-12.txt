includes imputations for the service flows from
durable goods, including IT products, employed
in the household and government sectors.
The imputations for services of IT equipment
are based on the cost of capital for IT described
in more detail below. The cost of capital is
multiplied by the nominal value of IT capital
stock to obtain the imputed service flow from IT
products. In the business sector this accrues as
capital income to the firms that employ these
products as inputs. In the household and government
sectors the flow of capital income must
be imputed. This same type of imputation is
used for housing in the NIPA. The rental value
of renter-occupied housing accrues to real estate
firms as capital income, while the rental
value of owner-occupied housing is imputed to
households.
Current dollar GDP in Table 1 is $9.8 trillions
in 1999, including imputations, and real
output growth averaged 3.46 percent for the
period 1948-1999. These magnitudes can be
compared to the current dollar value of $9.3
trillions in 1999 and the average real growth
rate of 3.40 percent for the period 1948-1999
for the official GDP. Table 1 presents the current
dollar value and price indexes of the GDP
and IT output. This includes outputs of investment
goods in the form of computers, software,
communications equipment, and non-IT investment
goods. It also includes outputs of non-IT
consumption goods and services as well as imputed
IT capital service flows from households
and governments.
The most striking feature of the data in Table
1 is the rapid price decline for computer investment,
17.1 percent per year from 1959 to 1995.
Since 1995 this decline has almost doubled to
32.1 percent per year. By contrast the relative
price of software has been flat for much of
the period and began to fall only in the late
1980's. The price of communications equipment
behaves similarly to the software price,
while the consumption of capital services from
computers and software by households and governments
shows price declines similar to computer
investment.
The top panel of Table 2 summarizes the
growth rates of prices and quantities for major
output categories for 1990-1995 and 1995-
1999. Business investments in computers,
software, and communications equipment are
the largest categories of IT spending. Households
and governments have also spent sizable
amounts on computers, software,
communications equipment and the services
of information technology. Figure 4 shows
that the output of software is the largest IT

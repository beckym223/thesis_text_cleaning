In redesigning the rate structure, I suggest
scrapping the multiple schedule system which
was developed to reduce the tax advantage
of married couples relative to single people
under income splitting. It is simpler to use
one set of rates and to rely on the personal
exemptions to take into account differences
in ability to pay of families of different size.47
The restored deduction for two-earner couples
(20 percent of the earnings of the spouse
with the lower earnings up to $70,000) would
help avoid a significant marriage penalty.
The same revenue and progressivity of
present law could be generated by a tax
schedule ranging from 7 percent on the first
$5,000 of taxable income to 26 percent on
taxable income in excess of $35,000, without
the bulge in tax rates under current law (see
Plan I, Table 7).48 Thus, a wide margin
exists for increasing progressivity at the top
of the income scale, while keeping rates
moderate. To restore the progressivity of the
federal tax system to its 1977 level, the range
of graduation would have to be expanded
and the rate of graduation increased. A starting
rate of 4 percent on the first $5,000 of
taxable income rising to 48 percent on tax-
47To avoid the old community property problem,
(see Pechman, 1987b, pp. 102-7) the brackets in the
rate schedules for married couples filing separate returns
would be one-half the size of the brackets for
single people.
48Exemptions and the standard deduction would remain
the same as in 1989, that is, exemptions would be
$2,000 per capita and the standard deduction would be
$3,100 for single persons, $4,550 for heads of households,
and $5,200 for married couples, all adjusted for
inflation.

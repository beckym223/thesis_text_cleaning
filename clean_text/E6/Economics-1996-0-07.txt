education experiment designed to alter smok-
ing and other risks for heart disease (Nathan
Maccoby and Douglas S. Solomon, 1981).
Identical regressions of smoking on school-
ing were estimated at age 17 and at age 24,
with schooling measured in both cases as the
number of years the individual would even-
tually complete. The most striking result was
the absence of any increase in the size of the
schooling coefficient between the ages of 17
and 24. The additional schooling could not
be the cause of the differential smoking be-
havior (and by extension the differential
health associated with smoking) at age 24
because the differences in smoking were al-
ready evident at age 17, before the dif-
ferences in schooling had emerged (Philip
Farrell and Fuchs, 1982) .20
In my judgment, the most likely explanation
for the high correlation between health and
schooling is that both reflect differences in
time preference (Fuchs, 1982). Both health
and schooling are aspects of investment in hu-
man capital; differences among individuals in
time preference that are established at an early
age could result in different amounts of in-
vestment in health and education.21
Although I believe there have been many
fruitful interactions between economics and
health, the political debate over health care
reform in 1993-1994 benefited much less
than it could have from the insights of econ-
omists. Possible explanations for the failure
of health economics research to have more
impact on policy are explored in the next
section.
II. The Present
George Stigler's Presidential Address to the
American Economic Association in December
1964 was distinctive in its emphasis on proph-
ecy over preaching. To be specific, Stigler pre-
dicted that economics was "at the threshold of
its golden age" (Stigler, 1965 p. 17) because
"the age of quantification is now full upon us"
(p. 16). The growth of empirical estimation
was, for Stigler, "a scientific revolution of the
very first magnitude" (p. 17). He believed
that empirical research would have an impact
on policy far beyond anything possible from
theory alone because "a theory can usually be
made to support diverse policy positions. The-
ories present general relationships, and which
part of a theory is decisive in a particular con-
text is a matter of empirical evidence" (p. 13).
With regard to health care, Stigler's predic-
tion of a vast expansion in empirical research
has been amply fulfilled. During the past 30
years economists have published thousands of
empirical articles on various aspects of health
and medical care. But the shallow and incon-
clusive debate over health policy in 1993-
1994 contradicts his expectation that this
research would narrow the range of partisan
disputes and make a significant contribution to
the reconciliation of policy differences.22 What
went wrong?
One possibility is that the research was in-
conclusive. If health economists cannot agree
among themselves, why should their research
have a salutary effect on public policy? Sec-
ond, even if the research were conclusive, it
would not be of much help to policy if the
results were not adequately disseminated to a
wider audience. A third possible explanation
is that the policy debate foundered on differ-
ences in values, differences which could not
be reconciled by empirical research, however
conclusive and however well disseminated.
To gain some insight into these matters,
I prepared a 20-question survey concerning
health economics and health policy and sent it
to health economists, economic theorists, and
practicing physicians. The health economists
were those whom I considered to be the lead-

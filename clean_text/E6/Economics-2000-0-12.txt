A striking difference between the developing
countries at the end of the twentieth century and
the developed countries at the end of the nine-
teenth century is that the lowest-income coun-
tries have achieved rates of infant mortality and
life expectancy that are significantly superior to
those attained at the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury in the developed countries.
The infant mortality rate for 30 low-income
developing countries, including China, in
1960 was 157 per thousand births and it de-
clined by 62 percent to 62 in 1996 (IJNDP,
1998). The infant mortality rate in 1900 in
nine European countries ranged from a low of
121 in Denmark to a high of 216 in Austria
(Bairoch, 1988 p. 231). The rate in the United
States was 160. The teeming cities of the
developing world are often viewed negatively
by observers from the developed world. A
recent publication has the title "The Poverty
of Cities in the Developing World" (Martin
Brockerhoff and Ellen Brennan, 1997). Yet
the study revealed that cities with a popula-
tion of a million or more included in their
sample had an infant mortality rate of 60 per
thousand births in the 1990's (Brockerhoff
and Brennan, 1997 p. 24). Two comparisons
are relevant. Estimates of infant mortality for
the first decade of the twentieth century were
500 to 600 for Bombay and 350 to 400 in
Singapore (Bairoch, 1988 p. 450). The infant
mortality rate in New York City at the begin-
ning of the twentieth century was 264 (We-
ber, 1899 p. 346).
While infant mortality rates in cities in the
developed world at the beginning of the twen-
tieth century were higher than in rural areas, in
the developing world the rates in the cities are
now below those in rural areas (Brockerhoff and
Brennan, 1997 p. 24). These data indicate both
the large magnitude of the declines and the
extent to which the improvements have been
widely shared, even among many of the lowest-
income families in the world.
Significant increases in life expectancy were
achieved between 1900 and mid-century in the
developing countries, though much greater ab-
solute increases came later. The best available
long-term data are for India, at least one benefit
of being a British colony. Life expectancy in
India in 1900 was 23 years, increasing to 32
years in the 1940's (Bogue, 1969 p. 572) and to
43 years in 1960 and 62 years in 1996.10 Life
expectancy increased by 170 percent in a cen-
tury--it is now almost three times what it was a
hundred years ago. Life expectancy in the
world's poorest countries has increased since
1940 at a far more rapid rate than achieved in
any country in the developed world in the nine-
teenth century. This is an area where there has
been convergence between the rich and the poor
countries over the past several decades. At the
end of the nineteenth century life expectancy in
seven industrial countries ranged from 46 to 51
(Bogue, 1969). In 33 low-income countries in
1996 life expectancy was 64 years, compared to
44 years in 1960, an absolute increase of 20
years (World Bank, 1998). Furthermore, the
improvements in infant mortality and life ex-
pectancy have been achieved at lower levels of
real per capita incomes than those prevailing in
the developed countries at the beginning of the
twentieth century (Maddison, 1995). The
knowledge about the benefits of clean water and
sanitation has been widely distributed and in-
vestments have been made to make those ben-
efits widely available."
Since the late 1940's there has been greater
improvement in the world's availability of food
than had occurred in all previous history. The
evidence is the increase in per capita food sup-
plies that occurred in the developing countries,
with nearly 80 percent of the world's popula-
tion. There are reasonably reliable estimates of
daily per capita supply of calories for 1961-
10 Other data on life expectancies indicate that in 1896-
1997 it was 32 years in Russia and in 1900, 35 years in
Spain (Bogue, 1969 pp. 576-77). The earliest estimates for
several African countries are for the 1940's and 1950's and
range from 27 to 40 years.  "1 The area of the world that appears to have participated
least in the recent improvements in well-being is Sub-
Saharan Africa. Per capita income measures show that in the
majority of the countries real incomes have fallen in the last
three decades. However, John Sender (1999) has shown that
there have been significant improvements in infant mortality
and life expectancy in the region. He estimates that in 1950
life expectancy was about 30 years, whereas a girl born in
1995 had a life expectancy of 54 years (Sender, 1999 p. 91).
The unweighted child mortality rate (per thousand) for the
18 countries was 254 in 1960 and it declined to 139 in 1995,
a decline of 45 percent. Sender shows that by a number of
other measures, such as female enrollment rates in schools,
the number of tractors, average grain yields, and the number
of radio and television sets, substantial improvements oc-  cuffed.

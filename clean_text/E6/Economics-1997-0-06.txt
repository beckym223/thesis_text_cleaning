It was stipulated that a low-cost producer or
producers were already in operation abroad;
then, the argument proceeded, a potential en-
trant in a developing country would be faced
with an initial period of high costs, but could
in the longer run compete. However, in the
presence of dynamic externalities (presum-
ably internal to the industry), it was believed
that no individual producer would find it prof-
itable to start production. In these circum-
stances, the infant industry argument could
justify temporary intervention to make entry
into the new industry privately profitable pro-
vided that, over the longer term, its costs
would decline below the imported cost by
enough to yield an economic return on the in-
tervening loss, which could be viewed as an
investment.
Although the infant industry argument was,
in a first-best world, an argument for a pro-
duction subsidy (which would presumably
equal the unit value of the externality and
might apply as well for production for exports
as for the domestic market), it was combined
with the appeal for import substitution14 to
yield a justification for protection of newly es-
tablished manufacturing industries in devel-
oping countries.
However, combining the assumptions that
industrialization would have to take place
through substituting for imports, that there
were infant industries requiring initial inter-
vention, and that export earnings were un-
likely to increase, the stage was set for trade
and industrialization policies.
The premises underlying import-substitution
policies were so widely accepted that devel-
oping country exceptions were even incorpo-
rated into the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) articles. Article XVIII
explicitly protected the developing countries
from the "obligations" of industrialized coun-
tries and permitted them to adopt tariffs and
quantitative restrictions. They also were enti-
tled to "special and differential treatment" in
other regards under GATT. That the GATT,
the upholder of an open international trading
system, would accept an "exception" for
developing countries shows how deeply en-
trenched the views supporting import substi-
tution were. It is arguable that the very
existence of this exception not only legiti-
mized developing countries' inner-oriented
trade policies, but also removed pressures
that might otherwise have been brought to
bear earlier for them to adopt trade and pay-
ments regimes more conducive to economic
growth. "
D. Resulting Evolution of Policies
In one way or another, provision was made
in country after country that, once domestic
production became feasible, imports would be
restricted. In Brazil, a "Law of Similars" pro-
vided that firms importing goods that were
similar to those available domestically would
lose their government privileges, which in-
cluded not only access to credit and tax treat-
ment, but also eligibility to bid on government
contracts and a variety of other valuable rights.
In India, imports were licensed, and in the
event that there was domestic production, any
would-be importer was required to obtain let-
ters from any supplier government officials
thought might be capable of producing the
good to the effect that the supplier could not
meet the specifications. In Turkey, goods were
removed from the list of items for which im-
port licenses could be granted once domestic
production capacity was available. Similar
provisions, or very high tariffs, were used to
encourage import substitution in most devel-
oping countries."

has noted, "The case of product differentiation
has proved particularly resistant to
general equilibrium analysis" (p. 45).14
And so, as power blocs multiplied in a
pluralistic world, as firms grew larger and
as conglomerates were added to vertical
and horizontal combinations, as advertising
expenditures mounted to influence
spending out of rising discretionary income,
as the problem of externalities became
ever more important, and as the role
of government in the functioning of markets
steadily increased, micro-economic
theory largely averted its eyes and became
ever more enamored of hypothetical systems
of general equilibrium under conditions
of perfect competition.'5
In the meantime, instructors in undergraduate
micro theory have resolutely continued
to teach their students the essentials
of the Chamberlinian partial equilibrium
analysis, with downward sloping demand
curves facing the individual firm,
and laying down the conditions for shortrun
and long-run equilibrium on an industry
basis. That much, at least, undergraduates
seem able to absorb, and some
factual counterparts can be found for the
theoretical analysis. But at the graduate
level in many universities, and the more so
the more advanced the level of instruction,
Walras and Pareto and their successors
take over, and the analysis proceeds on the
basis of the conditions associated with atomistic
competition.
A further example, reflecting another dimension
of the growth of large-scale business,
involves the conditions under which
decisions are made in the large firm.'6 Involved
here are a number of issues which
have been the subject of some theoretical
analysis and a good deal of empirical work
in the postwar years, but very little of the
results of this work has yet found its way
into main corpus of micro-economic theory.
I have in mind such questions as the relative
roles of profit maximizing and of other
criteria in the decision rules used in the
large firm, the effects of the separation of
ownership and management on these optimization
criteria, the ways in which the
bureaucratization of decision making affects
the manner in which business firms
respond to market stimuli, and the effect
of the improvements in the gathering and
processing of information that have come
not only from the revolution in data
processing but also from the development
of a more scientific approach to decision
making.'7 What has been the effect of all
this on the pricing decisions of large firms,
the manner in which they participate in
wage negotiations, or how their investment
planning responds to current and prospective
developments in product and financial
markets? And there are other examples
of the same sort. Early work not only in

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
him, a purely static theory of general equilib-
rium. Fluctuations in production and employ-
ment, due to monetary disturbances or to shocks
of any other kind, were viewed as inducing
disequilibrium adjustments, unrelated to any-
one's purposeful behavior, modeled with vast
numbers of free parameters. For us, today, value
theory refers to models of dynamic economies
subject to unpredictable shocks, populated by
agents who are good at processing information
and making choices over time. The macroeco-
nomic research I have discussed today makes
essential use of value theory in this modem
sense: formulating explicit models, computing
solutions, comparing their behavior quantita-
tively to observed time series and other data
sets. As a result, we are able to form a much
sharper quantitative view of the potential of
changes in policy to improve peoples' lives than
was possible a generation ago.

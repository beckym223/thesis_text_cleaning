complement (32 percent) would represent
the initial value added associated with neg-
ative TFP performance during the period.
If, then, all the information could be gen-
erated by a properly designed frequency dis-
tribution of rates of TFP growth, could it not
all be the result of chance alone-more spe-
cifically, of errors of measurements? I really
think not-my favorite quip on this is that
"white noise does not sing a tune." That is, if
we can rationalize what we see in terms of an
analytical framework which embodies well-
established economic principles and sensible
presumptions about underlying relationships
and facts, this is itself strong evidence against
the white noise hypothesis.
Nonetheless, we have to face the fact that
errors of observation of some magnitude cer-
tainly do exist, and we must recognize that
they can cloud our perceptions and bias our
results. What I am going to do here is consider
frequency distributions of firms. TFP is mea-

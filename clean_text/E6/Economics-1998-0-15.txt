complement (32 percent) would represent
the initial value added associated with negative
TFP performance during the period.
If, then, all the information could be generated
by a properly designed frequency distribution
of rates of TFP growth, could it not
all be the result of chance alone-more specifically,
of errors of measurements? I really
think not-my favorite quip on this is that
"white noise does not sing a tune." That is, if
we can rationalize what we see in terms of an
analytical framework which embodies wellestablished
economic principles and sensible
presumptions about underlying relationships
and facts, this is itself strong evidence against
the white noise hypothesis.
Nonetheless, we have to face the fact that
errors of observation of some magnitude certainly
do exist, and we must recognize that
they can cloud our perceptions and bias our
results. What I am going to do here is consider
frequency distributions of firms. TFP is measured

who were most heroically
moved by a sense of outrage against their
personal identity, and who were least affected
by the cost-benefit analysis. In this
year of crisis I havte also learned something
about myself-that it is easier to
make heroic decisions as a member of the
committee than it is as a sole decisionmaker
and that heroism is much less appropriate
in political than it is in personal
decisions. The lessons of this year, therefore,
are that the study of economics does
not produce clods, even if perhaps the
American Economic Association does not
produce undue heroics. So we can hope at
least that economics is one of the inputs
that helps to make us human. If so, the
benefits of this strange activity will be
well worth its undoubted cost, even if in
our heroic mood we dare not calculate
them.

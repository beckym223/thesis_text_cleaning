percentage points, the contribution of labor input
rose by only 0.24 percent, and TFP accelerated by
0.51 percent. Growth in ALP rose 0.92 as more
rapid capital deepening and growth in TFP offset
slower improvement in labor quality. Growth in
hours worked accelerated as unemployment fell to
a 30-year low. Labor markets have tightened con-
siderably, even as labor-force participation rates
increased.37
The contribution of capital input reflects the
investment boom of the late 1990's as busi-
nesses, households, and governments poured
resources into plant and equipment, especially
computers, software, and communications
equipment. The contribution of capital, predom-
inantly IT, is considerably more important than
the contribution of labor. The contribution of IT
capital services has grown steadily throughout
the period 1948-1999, but Figure 9 reflects the
impact of the accelerating decline in IT prices.
After maintaining an average rate of 0.25 per-
cent for the period 1973-1990, TFP growth fell to
0.24 percent for 1990-1995 and then vaulted to
0.75 percent per year for 1995-1999. This is a
major source of growth in output and ALP for the
U.S. economy (Figures 11 and 12). While TFP
growth for 1995-1999 is lower than the rate of
1948-1973, the U.S. economy is recuperating
from the anemic productivity growth of the past
two decades. Although only half of the accelera-
tion in TFP from 1990-1995 to 1995-1999 can be
attributed to IT production, this is far greater than
the 4.26 percent share of IT in the GDP.
G. Average Labor Productivity
Output growth is the sum of growth in hours
and average labor productivity. Table 8 shows
the breakdown between growth in hours and
ALP for the same periods as in Table 6. For the
period 1948-1999, ALP growth predominated
in output growth, increasing just over 2 percent
per year for 1948-1999, while hours increased
about 1.4 percent per year. As shown in equa-
tion (3), ALP growth depends on capital deep-
ening, a labor-quality effect, and TFP growth.

1963 when the daily per capita supply was
1,940 k/cals. In 1994-1996 the supply was
2,580 (Nikos Alexandratos, 1999 p. 5908)-a
remarkable increase of 33 percent, given that
population doubled during the period. Based on
the increase in per capita grain production from
1948-1952 to 1961-1963, it can be estimated
that the per capita calorie supply was about
1,700 in 1948-1952. The increase in calories
per capita available in the developing countries
from 1948-1952 to 1994-1996 was of the order
of 50 percent.12 Since developing countries
produce at least 90 percent of the food they
consume, this means that food production almost
trebled in four decades! This could not
have happened prior to the last half of the twentieth
century; the knowledge that made it possible
did not then exist.
Alexandratos (1999 p. 5908) provides a picture
of the improvement in food supplies that
adds another dimension to the increase in the
per capita availability in the developing countries:
" ... the part of the world population living
in countries where per capita food supplies are
still very low (under 2,200 k/cal/day) decreased
considerably to only 10% in the mid-1990s,
down from 56% 30 years earlier." Note that the
2,200 calories per day that is now defined as
very low is somewhat higher than was available
in England and significantly higher than in
France in 1800, just two centuries ago. True, the
average citizen of England and France as of
1800 was stunted and/or wasted-as short in
height and low in weight-just as the average
person in the developing countries with significantly
less than 2,200 calories per day would
be similarly designated today. What is important
is that this level of consumption applies to
countries with only a tenth of the world's population
while 200 years ago it applied to nearly
all of the world's population.
It is estimated that in 1990 approximately
780 million persons (19 percent of the developing-
country population, down from 36 percent
in 1969-1971) were malnourished (Alexandratos,
1995 p. 33). There is an adequate quantity
of food now produced to provide these people
with sufficient calories. However, as Adam
Smith taught us, policies are an important factor
determining how well a nation utilizes its resources.
The majority of the malnourished people
live in rural areas and most of them live in
countries that have had policies that discriminated
against agriculture and rural people for all
or part of the last three decades. The most
effective means to eliminate such malnutrition
is to increase the incomes of farm people in
these countries, something that would occur
with more appropriate policies (Johnson, 1999
p. 52).
In my opening sentence I stated that not only
are people better fed than ever before, but they
acquire their food at the lowest cost in all history.
There is no way to prove that the real cost
per calorie is the lowest in all history, but we do
know that nearly all people are now devoting a
smaller percentage of their consumption expenditures
to the acquisition of food than was true
at times past. As recently as 1955 families in the
United States allocated 23 percent of their consumption
expenditure to food; today it is about
10 percent. For Japan the reduction was from 54
to 20 percent and for South Korea from 50 to 36
percent. Between 1960 and 1990 the food share
in Thailand declined from 47 to 23 percent
(United Nations, National Account Statistics). It
is not unreasonable to assume that at the beginning
of the nineteenth century in the developed
countries that 70 percent or more of the consumption
expenditures went for food and that
the percentage was even higher at the beginning
of the twentieth century for the developing
countries. 13
12 Grain provides 75 to 80 percent of calories consumed
in the low-income developing countries. From 1961-1963
to 1988-1990, per capita grain production increased by 25
percent, almost the same as the per capita increase in per
capita calorie supplies. Data are available on grain production
for 1948-1952. From that period to 1961-1963 per
capita grain production increased by 14 percent. Thus one
may estimate that per capita calorie supplies in 1948-1952
were approximately 1,700 (1,940/1.14 = 1,701).
13In discussing the benefits of the increase in knowledge
and substantially higher incomes generated by that knowledge,
I have said nothing directly about the possibility of
environmnental degradation. While in some and, perhaps,
many respects the environment has been degraded in the
twentieth century, in terms of the effects on life and overall
health, the net effect has been strikingly positive. The declines
in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy
have been due largely to improved nutrition and environmental
improvements in terms of sanitation and clean water.
True, some features of the twentieth century, such as air

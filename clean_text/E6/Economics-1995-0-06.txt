III. Social Preference, Social Choice,
and Impossibility
The preceding discussion makes abundant
use of the idea of "social preference."
Should it be dropped, as suggested by
Buchanan? And if so, what would remain of
Arrow's impossibility theorem?
We have to distinguish between two quite
different uses of the notion of "social preference,
" related respectively to (i) the operation
of decision mechanisms, and (ii) the
making of social welfare judgments. The first
notion of "social preference" is something
like the "underlying preference" on which
choices actually made for the society by
prevailing mechanisms are implicitly based
-a kind of "revealed preference" of the
society.11 This "derivative" view of social
preference would be, formally, a binary representation
of the choices emerging from
decision mechanisms.
The second idea of "social preference"
as social welfare judgments-reflects a view
of the social good: some ranking of what
would be better or worse for the society.
Such judgments would be typically made by
a given person or agency. Here too an aggregation
is involved, since an individual
who is making judgments about social welfare,
or about the relative goodness of distinct
social states, must somehow combine
the diverse interests and preferences of different
people.
Buchanan's objection is quite persuasive
for the first interpretation (involving decision
mechanisms), especially since there is
no a priori presumption that the mechanisms
used must -or even should -necessarily
lead to choices that satisfy the requirements
of binary representation (not to
mention the more exacting demands of an
ordering representation).12 On the other
hand, the second interpretation does not
involve this problem, and even an individual
when expressing a view about social welfare
needs a concept of this kind.13 When applied
to the making of social welfare judgments
by an individual or an agency, Arrow's
impossibility theorem thus cannot be disputed
on the ground that some organic existence
is being imputed to the society. The
amelioration of impossibility must be sought
elsewhere (see Section IV). However,
Buchanan's critique of Arrow's theorem
would apply to mechanisms of social decision
(such as voting procedures).
Would the dropping of the requirement
that social choices be based on a binary
relation-in particular a transitive ordering
-negate the result in the case of social
decision mechanisms? A large literature has
already established that the arbitrariness of
power, of which Arrow's case of dictatorship
is an extreme example, lingers in one
form or another even when transitivity is
dropped, so long as some regularity is demanded
(such as the absence of cycles).'4
There is, however, cause for going further,
precisely for the reasons identified by
Buchanan, and to eschew not just the transitivity
of social preference, but the idea of
social preference itself. All that is needed
from the point of view of choice is that the
decision mechanisms determine a "choice
function" for the society, which identifies

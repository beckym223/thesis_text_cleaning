reductions stemming from 1001 different
causes, though I recognize that one can build
scenarios in which even 1001 causes could
work rather evenly over the whole economy.
Personally, I have always gravitated toward
the "mushrooms" side of this dichotomy. I
remember being impressed, when I first saw
some early industry estimates of TFP improvement,
by their tendency to industry concentration.
For years I told my students that the
1920's were the decade of cars and rubber
tires, the 1930's the decade of refrigerators,
the 1940's that of pharmaceuticals (especially
antibiotics), and the 1950's that of television,
with telecommunications anid computers taking
over in recent decades. But these were just
impressions, not based on any systematic approach.
My real turnaround came in the course
of writing my 1990 paper, where I presented
a series of tables based on Kendrick and Elliot
S. Grossman's (1980) work. Table 2 is an
example.
Table 2 has the same format as Table 1. Column
(1) presents the familiar measure of the
percentage by which TFP grew, or real costs
were reduced, during the period in question
(note that the percentages apply to the period
1958-1967 as a whole; they are not annual

FIGURE 2. ILLUSTRATIVE TFP GROWTH PROFILES (SUNRISE-SUNSET DIAGRAMS)
C, and D. First, we order the industries in descending
order, according to their rates of TFP
increase in the period. Then we calculate cumulative
real cost reduction (a real dollar
amount) and plot it against cumulative initial
real value added. Then we scale the vertical
axis so as to comply with whatever metric we
have decided upon for the TFP growth rate (in
the example, a 30-degree line representing a
1-percent annual TFP growth rate), and the
horizontal axis so as to add up to 100 percent.
In the lower panel of Figure 2 1 give examples
to show how these diagrams cope with
the problems of a low TFP growth rate (the
overshoot for the case of 0.25-percent growth
would show up peaking at over 400 percent in

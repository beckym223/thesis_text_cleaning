least three distinct social states and at least
two (but not infinitely many) individuals,
Arrow also wanted a social welfare function
to yield a social ordering for every possible
combination of individual preferences; that
is, it must have a universal domain. A second
condition is called the independence of
irrelevant alternatives. This can be defined in
different ways, and I shall choose an extremely
simple form. The way a society ranks
a pair of alternative social states x and y
should depend on the individual preferences
only over that pair-in particular,
not on how the other ("irrelevant") alternatives
are ranked.

Now consider the idea of some people
being "decisive": a set G of people-I shall
call them a group G-having their way no
matter what others prefer. In ranking a pair
x and y, if it turns out that x gets socially
ranked above y whenever everyone in group
G prefers x to y (no matter what preferences
those not in G have), then G is decisive
over that ordered pair (x, y). When a
group G is decisive over all ordered pairs, it
is simply "decisive."

Arrow required that no individual (formally,
no single-member group) should be
decisive (nondictatorship), but-following
the Paretian tradition-also demanded that
the group of all individuals taken together
should be decisive (the Pareto principle).
The "impossibility theorem," in this version
(presented in Arrow [1963]), shows that it is
impossible to have a social welfare function
with universal domain, satisfying independence,
the Pareto principle, and nondictatorship.


The theorem can be proved in three simple
steps.8 The first two steps are the following
(with the second lemma drawing on
the first).

FIELD-EXPANSION LEMMA: If a group
is decisive over any pair of states, it is decisive.
9

GROUP-CONTRACTION LEMMA: If a
group (of more than one person) is decisive,
then so is some smaller group contained in
it.

The final step uses the Group-Contraction
Lemma to prove the theorem. By the Pareto
principle, the group of all individuals is decisive.
Since it is finite, by successive partitioning
(and each time picking the decisive
part), we arrive at a decisive individual, who
must, thus, be a dictator. Hence the impossibility.

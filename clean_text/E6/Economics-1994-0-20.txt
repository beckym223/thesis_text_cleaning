not just idle intellectual curiosities. They
affect what we feel about ourselves and the
future.

Returning to the topic of technical
change, our expectations of what economics
can deliver here may also be excessive. It is
unlikely that we can have a fully "endogenous"
theory of technical change. Yes, both
the rate and direction of inventive activity
are subject to economic influences and analysis.
So also is the diffusion of innovations.
But the outcome of inventive activity is not
really predictable. True "innovation" is an
innovation. If it were knowable in advance
it would not be one, and the innovators
would not be able to collect any rents. In
that sense it is futile to expect that we could
control it fully or predict it well.24 Given the
fundamental uncertainties entailed in the
creative act, in invention, and in innovation,
there is no reason to expect the fit of our
models to be high or for the true residual to
disappear. We should, however, be able to
"explain" it better ex post even if we cannot
predict it.

The metaphor of the glass half-empty is
also misleading. As we fill it, the glass keeps
growing. A major aspect of learning is that
the unknown keeps expanding as we learn.
This should be looked at positively. It is
much better this way-especially for those
of us who are engaged in research!

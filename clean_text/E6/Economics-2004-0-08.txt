informed and well-educated. The presence of
mandatory annuitization does not prevent be-
quests, although it raises the cost and requires
action to do so. Those surviving to the start of
their benefits and with sufficient life expectancy
can use part of their monthly Social Security
benefits to finance a long-term life insurance
contract, thereby providing a bequest with an
explicit choice of the relationship between the
real size of the bequest and the date of death.
This action contrasts with simply leaving un-
spent funds to one's heirs, a strategy that leaves
an amount dependent on the history of con-
sumption relative to the income earned on  assets.20
In other words, the government's choice be-
tween providing retirement benefits as annuities
or as lump sums can be considered as a choice
of a default, one which most individuals could
reverse-by purchasing life insurance if pro-
vided an annuity or purchasing an annuity if
offered a lump sum (B. Douglas Berheim,
1991). Reversing the government choice,
though, takes time, thought, and effort and it has
a cost. That is, the government provides annu-
itization at a far lower cost than does the private
market. The absence of selling costs (other than
equivalent information provision) and econo-
mies of scale contribute to this advantage. Ad-
ministrative costs of Social Security are less
than 1 percent of annual expenditures, and a
great deal of that is due to the disability pro-
gram, which is naturally more expensive to run.
In contrast, privately provided insurance has
higher costs-life insurance company account-
ing generally recognizes over 10 percent of
premia used for administrative costs and profit.
The private market is more expensive and does
not do a better job of delivering annuity prod-
ucts that people need.21 This is one reason to

have government provision rather than a man-
date to purchase an annuity in the private mar-
ket.22 As with many other settings, we expect
individuals to undo little of what is provided.23
So it makes sense to offer what we think people
might sensibly want. Moreover, the wider func-
tioning of the life insurance market than the
annuities market suggests a further advantage to
using substantial annuitization as the default.
A mandatory retirement income program re-
quires a choice of the form of benefit and it is
hard to think of a basis for choosing the form
which is other than what makes sense for the
bulk of the population. It seems to me that this
is an annuity in some form.24

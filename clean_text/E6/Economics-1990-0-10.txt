to estimates of the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO), in 1977, when the top income
tax rate was 70 percent and the general
corporate tax rate was 48 percent, the Gini
coefficient of inequality was 0.4502 before
tax and 0.4185 after federal taxes (more than
half of which were individual and corporate
income taxes). In 1980, when the top tax rate
was still 70 percent (though only on unearned
income) and the corporate rate was
46 percent, the Gini coefficient was 0.4627
before tax and 0.4320 after the same taxes.
Thus, as measured by the Gini coefficient,
the equalization achieved by the federal tax
system declined from a modest 0.0317 points
(7.0 percent) in 1977 to an even more modest
0.0307 points (6.6 percent) in 1980 (Table 4).
Two major pieces of tax legislation were
enacted during the 1980s. One increased inequality,
the other reduced it. The 1981 Act,
enacted after Ronald Reagan's sweeping victory
in the 1980 presidential election, increased
inequality by reducing income tax
rates by 23 percent across the board (with a
top rate on ordinary income of 50 percent),
lowering the capital gains rate to a maximum
of 20 percent, introducing generous
deductions for individual retirement accounts,
and providing very liberal depreciation
allowances for business investment on
top of the previously enacted investment tax
credit. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced
inequality by increasing personal exemptions
and the standard deduction, equalizing the
tax rates on capital gains and ordinary income,
and closing numerous loopholes. At
the same time, income tax rates were reduced
to a maximum of 33 percent on individuals
and 34 percent on corporations.
Despite the large rate cuts at the top of
the income scale, the 1986 act increased income
tax progression, though not to the 1980
level. By 1984, the equalization provided by
the federal tax system had declined to 0.0184
points (3.8 percent) in terms of the Gini
coefficient. As a result of the 1986 act, the
degree of equalization increased to 0.0218
points (4.4 percent) in 1988 (Table 4). While
this change is modest, it is noteworthy as the
first movement toward greater income tax
progressivity at least since 1964, when the
Kennedy-Johnson tax cut was enacted.
I suggest that a minimal goal of federal
tax policy in the next several years should be
to restore the equalization achieved by the
federal tax system in the mid-1970s.34 While
this may appear to be a modest goal, it turns
out to be a rather ambitious undertaking,
particularly if income tax rates are to be
kept to moderate levels. Before calculating
the tax rates, it is necessary first to establish
the appropriate tax base for a modem income
tax.
Reform of the Income Tax
The proper base for the income tax was
described fifty years ago by Henry Simons,
who argued that it should conform with an
economic definition of income.35 Admittedly,
the use of a comprehensive income tax con-
14.1 percent in 1985. It is scheduled to rise further in
1990 to 15.3 percent. The maximum taxable earnings
level rose from $4,800 in 1960 to $7,800 in 1970, $25,900
in 1980, $39,600 in 1985, and $48,000 in 1989. The
maximum taxable earnings levels have been adjusted for
inflation since 1984. For details see Pechman (1987), p.  332.
34Specifically, as the basis for revision, I use the
distribution of federal tax burdens in 1977 when the
CBO tax incidence series begins. I do not mean to imply
that the federal tax system in the mid-1970s had exactly
the correct degree of equalization.

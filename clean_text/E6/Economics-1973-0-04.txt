In leading centers of instruction faculty
responsibility is either secure or increas-
ingly so. But in place of the old censorship
has come a new despotism. That consists in
defining scientific excellence as whatever is
closest in belief and method to the
scholarly tendency of the people who are
already there. This is a pervasive and
oppressive thing not the less dangerous for
being, in the frequent case, both self-
righteous and unconscious.
But there are problems even with this
control. Neoclassical or neo-Keynesian
economics, though providing unlimited op-
portunity for demanding refinement, has
a decisive flaw. It offers no useful handle
for grasping the economic problems that
now beset the modern society. And these
problems are obtrusive-they will not lie
down and die as a favor to our profession.
No arrangement for the perpetuation of
thought is secure if that thought does not
make contact with the problems that it is
presumed to solve.
I will not omit this evening to mention
the failures of neoclassical theory. But I
want also to urge the means by which we
can reassociate ourselves with reality.
Some of this will summarize past argu-
ment, more a book that is presently to be
published. At this stage even the most con-
servative among my listeners will be re-
assured. To speak well of one's own pub-
lished and unpublished writing, whatever
one's other aberrations, is strongly in our
professional tradition.

The most commonplace features of neo-
classical and neo-Keynesian economics are
the assumptions by which power, and
therewith political content, is removed
from the subject. The business firm is sub-
ordinate to the instruction of the market
and, thereby, to the individual or house-
hold. The state is subordinate to the in-
struction of the citizen. There are excep-
tions but these are to the general and con-
trolling rule, and it is firmly on the rule
that neoclassical theory is positione(l. If
the business firm is subordinate to the
market--if that is its master--then it does
not have power to deploy in the economy
save as this is in the service of the market
and the consumer. And the winning of
action to influence or rig the behavior of
markets apart, it cannot bring power to
bear on the state for there the citizen is in
charge.
The decisive weakness in neoclassical
and neo-Keynesian economics is not the
error in the assumptions by which it elides
the problem of power. The capacity for
erroneous belief is very great, especially
where it coincides with convenience.
Rather in eliding power--in making eco-
nomics a nonpolitical subject---neoclassi-
cal theory, by the same process, destroys
its relation with the real world. The prob-
lems of this world, moreover, are increasing,
both in number and in the depth of their
social affliction. In consequence neoclassi-
cal and neo-Keynesian economics is rele-
gating its players to the social sidelines
where they either call no plays or urge the
wrong ones.
Specifically the exclusion of power and
the resulting political content from eco-
nomics causes it to foretell only two in-
trinsic and important economic problems.
One of these is the microeconomic problem
of market imperfection-more specifically
of monopoly or oligopoly in product or
factor markets leading to aberration in
resource and income distribution. The
other is the macroeconomic problem of un-
employment or inflation-of a deficiency
or excess in the aggregate demand for
goods and services, including that asso-
ciated with monetary effects. And on both
problems the failure is dramatic. Neo-
classical economics leads to the wrong
solution of the microeconomic problem
and to no solution of the macroeconomic

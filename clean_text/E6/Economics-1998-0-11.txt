a Lorenz-type diagram) and of negative TFP
growth (where it is hard to even conceptualize
a Lorenz-type picture).
I first presented these diagrams before a
large audience at the Western Economic Association
meetings in Seattle (July 1997), and
for that presentation coined the label of "sunrise
diagrams" on their analogy with the sun
rising over a hill. That same evening Yoram
Barzel suggested that where the aggregate
slope is negative, we apply the term "sunset
diagrams," which I immediately accepted.
Figure 3 presents a set of sunrise-sunset
diagrams based on Jorgenson et al. (1987 pp.
188-90). These cover 32 industrial sectors
(their 35 minus Agriculture, Trade, and
Government Enterprises). I think the utility
of sunrise-sunset diagrams needs no further
championing once these pictures are examined
and digested. Practically all variants are
represented in these real-world cases: low
TFP growth with a huge overshoot (1953-
1957 and 1969-1973); negative growth
with large and moderate overshoots (1966-
1969 and 1973-1979); moderate growth
with small (1979-1985), medium (1960-
1966), and large (1948-1953) overshoots.
One striking fact that emerges from this set
of pictures is how variable across periods is
the negative contribution of the losers. If the
losers had only contributed zero change in
TFP, we would have had cumulative TFP contributions
of about 0.8 percent per annum in
1948-1953, in 1957-1960, and in 1960-
1966. And the other periods would not have
been much different: about 0.7 percent in
1953-1957 and in 1969-1973, 0.6 percent in
1966-1969, and 0.5 percent in 1973-1979
and 1979-1985. Instead of this narrow range
of cumulative contributions, we have an actual
distribution that goes from -0.9 percent in
1973- 1979 through around 0.1 percent in
1953-1957 and 1969-1973 to over 0.5
percent in 1960-1966 and 1979-1985.
Does this not suggest that we make a major
research push trying to improve our understanding
of the phenomenon of negative TFP
growth? What syndromes characterize the firms
and industries experiencing it? How much of it
stems from external shocks like international
prices? How much of it from competition
within the industry? How much of it represents
firms struggling to survive, yet experiencing
output levels well below their previous peaks
(and presumably below installed capacity)?
How much of it represents things like "labor
hoarding" as firms go through periods of
adversity?
IL. Yeast versus Mushrooms: Part II
I hope that in the previous section I have
made a convincing case concerning: (a) the
usefulness of sunrise-sunset diagrams, (b) the
aptness of the "yeast versus mushrooms" dichotomy,
and (c) the pervasiveness with
which the mushroom side of that dichotomy
seems to come out ahead when the GDP is
broken down into industries or industrial
branches for TFP analysis. The grand design
that emerges from the studies reported here,
and from just about all the other industry
breakdowns that I recall having seen, is that:
(i) a small-to-modest fraction of industries
can account for 100 percent of aggregate real
cost reduction in a period; (ii) the complementary
fraction of industries contains winners
and losers, the TFP contributions of
which cancel each other; (iii) the losers are
a very important part of the picture most of
the time, and contribute greatly to the variations
we observe in aggregate TFP performance;
and (iv) there is little evidence of
persistence from period to period of the leaders
in TFP performance.
The above results are, I think, very interesting
(in the sense of piquing our curiosity)
, very strong (in terms of their implications
about the nature of the growth
process), and very robust (in the sense that
they have wide applicability over different
data sets analyzed by different authors using
at least somewhat different methods). But
these results, so far, are quite compatible
with what I might call an "industry view"
of the TFP story. This is the way I, myself,
looked at the growth process until quite
recently-a vision that was reflected in my
stories about rubber tires and autos in the
1920's, refrigerators and other household
appliances in the 1930's, pharmaceuticals in
the 1940's, etc. The image that I had in
mind was one of yeast within each industry
and mushrooms between industries-a
commonality of TFP experience by firms within'
an industry, depending on that industry's

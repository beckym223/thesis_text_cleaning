OF MARKET INCOME BY INCOME PERCENTILE, 1985
cludes programs of public assistance that are
designed explicitly to help the poor, but it
also includes others that are not designed
primarily for this purpose (for example, retirement
and unemployment benefits and
health insurance). To evaluate the impact of
the tax-transfer system on the distribution of
income, cash and in-kind transfers must be
added to market incomes while taxes are
deducted.
While I cannot separate the effects of
transfer payments and of taxes on the recent
changes in the after-tax income distribution,
12 a snapshot for a recent year-
1985-suggests what happened (Figure 1).
When family units are arrayed by their incomes
from market production (wages,
salaries, interest, dividends, etc.), the U.S.
tax system is only mildly progressive. On the
other hand, transfer payments are highly
progressive. Taxes in 1985 were regressive in
the lowest deciles and proportional thereafter,
while transfer payments declined from
over 200 percent of market incomes in the
lowest decile to 1.4 percent in the highest.
On balance, families in the lowest three
deciles received more in transfers than they
paid in taxes, while those in the top seven
deciles paid more in taxes than they received
in transfers.
Clearly, the tax-transfer system is progressive,
mainly because of transfers, not taxes.
What we are doing in the United States is
financing redistributive transfers with taxes
that are roughly proportional to incomes.
Moreover, the tax system has been getting
12The income distributions used in the Brookings
MERGE file for 1966 were prepared on the basis of
incomes including transfer payments. After so many
years, it is impractical to reclassify the income and tax
data for 1966 by income excluding transfer payments.

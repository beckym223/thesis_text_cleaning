and, with quadratic utility, to uncertain incomes.
37 In standard terminology, the value of
her discounted income is called her wealth; the
amount of that wealth that can be spent without
its depletion is called permanent income.38 An
alternative expression of Friedman's hypothesis
is that consumption depends on permanent
rather than on current income.39
The permanent income hypothesis may be in
accordance with most standard economic models.
Nevertheless, it contradicted prior thinking
about the consumption function. Keynes, and
his followers, believed that current income
played an especially important role in the determination
of current consumption.
"The fundamental psychological law [emphasis
added], upon which we are entitled
to depend with great confidence both a
priori from our knowledge of human nature
and from the detailed facts of experience,
is that men are disposed, as a rule
and on the average, to increase their consumption
as income increases, but not by
as much as the increase in income" (Keynes,
The General Theory, 1936, 96).
It is true that The General Theory discussed a
long list of other factors that could affect consumption.
The list was sufficiently rich to include
not only current income, but also all the
other determinants of wealth, such as expected
future income and the rate of interest. But that
does not make Keynes's theory identical to
Friedman's. In the Keynesian theory, consumers
are more sensitive to current income than to
other changes in income that have similar effect
on the consumer's wealth.
A. Empirical Results and Their Explanation
A large number of tests have demonstrated the
excess sensitivity of consumption to current income,
in concert with the Keynesian consumption
function. For example, John Y. Campbell and
N. Gregory Mankiw (1989) nested both Friedman'
s view that consumption depends solely on
wealth and the simplified Keynesian view that
consumption depends solely on income. They
suppose that a fraction of consumers A are pure
Keynesians, while a fraction (1 - A) behave according
to the permanent income hypothesis; they
estimate A from the extent to which consumption
overreacts to changes in income that would be
predictable from past changes in income and consumption.
Usefully, then, A gives a natural measure
of the departure from the permanent income
hypothesis. The estimates of A are significant statistically
and also of significant magnitude economically:
between 40 and 50 percent (depending
upon whether three or five periods are used to
predict the change in current income).
Other studies corroborate such excess dependence
on current income: John Shea (1985), for
union members whose contracts specified their

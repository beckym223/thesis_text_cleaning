emissions prove unmanageable for eco-
nomic or political reasons, some of these
"geoengineering" options will invite atten-
tion. Second, if they do, and especially if
they prove to be within the budgetary capa-
bilities of individual nations, international
greenhouse diplomacy will be transformed.
VII
What remains nearly certain is that the
main responses to the greenhouse threat
will be adapting to climate as climate
changes and reducing carbon emissions.
(CFC's are potent greenhouse gases and, if
unchecked, might rival carbon dioxide in
decades to come; but international actions
are making good progress and are among
the cheapest ways of reducing greenhouse
emissions.)
Like estimates of warming, estimates of
the costs of reducing emissions require some
common but arbitrary objective to be com-
parable. A doubling of carbon became the
conventional benchmark for warming esti-
mates; no such benchmark for reduced car-
bon emissions has been adopted for estimat-
ing costs. (In principle, the estimates could
adopt that doubling: the issue could be for-
mulated as the cost of retarding the dou-
bling time by a decade, two decades, or half
a century.) Most estimates take as their
target a reduction of emissions either to a
specified fraction of what they would be in
the absence of controls, or to some fixed
ratio to the emissions of 1990 or the pro-
jected emissions of 2000 or 2010. The esti-
mates examine minimum-cost trajectories,
implicitly or explicitly assuming something
like a uniform tax on the carbon content of
fuel as the policy instrument. They typically
make some assumption about a "fallback"
energy technology, at least for electricity,
available at some price in some decade of
the next century. They have to project esti-
mates of non-price-induced improvements
in the use or avoidance of energy by indus-
tries and households. And if they deal with
global emissions, they have to make some
assumption about the distribution of abate-
ment efforts among nations, especially
among the developing countries, which, in-
cluding China, account for about a quarter
of emissions now and would be expected to
account for half by the middle of the next
century.
Any estimate of the cost of abatement
needs therefore to specify at least half a
dozen target assumptions. Furthermore, the
estimates are produced by people and insti-
tutions that do not simultaneously estimate
the costs associated with climate change,
either damages or costs of adapting; the
estimates do not optimize the combined
costs of abatement and climate change. A
"not unreasonable" target for reduction
might be delaying a doubling by, say, four
decades. One decade might be too trivial, a
century too ambitious, and four decades an
objective in which most audiences would be
interested. But nobody who makes such an
estimate wishes to be interpreted as propos-
ing that when all the uncertainties about
climate changes and their impacts have been
resolved, if they ever are resolved, the opti-
mum reduction in emissions will be found
to retard doubling by 40 years, or any other
specified period of time.
All I can do to summarize a multitude of
estimates is to specify an order of magni-
tude that many economists and the Con-
gressional Budget Office would not consider
outrageous. That is the figure I mentioned
earlier, possibly 2 percent of GNP for the
developed countries and a similar, but even
much more uncertain, percentage of GNP
for the developing world. The uncertainty
for the developing world is partly due to the
estimates being mainly derived from the
American economy.4
Two characteristics of these estimates
need to be emphasized. One is that they
tend to assume optimal technological ad-
justment, as in response to a carbon tax. To
the extent that carbon emissions are con-
trolled by direct regulatory measures, there
may be the usual expected inefficiencies,
and I leave the reader to make his own
adjustment.

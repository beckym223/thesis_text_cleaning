VII. The Glass Half-Full?
After a long detour I come back to the
original question: why don't we know more
about the sources of productivity growth
and the causes for its recent slowdown?
Why does it feel as if the glass is still
half-empty? First note that in a trivial sense
we are doing better: the residual is smaller.
But that is the bad news, not the good. It is
smaller not because we have succeeded in
providing a substantively fuller explanation
of output growth, but rather because mea-
sured output growth declined, leaving some
of these explanations in the dust. But we
are also doing better substantively. We know
much more about the components of growth
and where our measures are lacking. After
decades of work and contributions by Deni-
son, Jorgenson, Kendrick, and many others,
the conceptual and measurement underpin-
nings of the growth accounts are in much
better shape today. We now have extensive
micro data on firms, their productivity, their
R&D expenditures, and other variables. We
have more data on individual investments in
education and training, and we also have
more asset detail on capital formation. More
international data are now available, with
the OECD both collecting R&D data and
computing TFP numbers for many coun-
tries, and with Summers and Heston (1991)
providing comparable real GNP numbers
for many countries. Finally, we have much
more computing power and better econo-
metric techniques and frameworks for at-
tacking many of the problems that arise in
the analysis of such data. So what is still
missing?
We are caught up in a mixture of unmea-
surement, mismeasurement, and unrealistic
expectations. The productivity situation is
both better than we think and also worse. It
is likely that there have been significant
unmeasured productivity advances in many
of the service sectors (Bresnahan, 1986;
Baily and Gordon, 1988). Moreover, rising
R&D investment rates in the mid-1980's
and the recent rise in the number of patent
applications augur well for the future. Also,
productivity growth rates are probably un-
derestimated even in the "measurable" sec-
tors because they are based on "book value"
estimates of physical- and human-capital
stocks and do not reflect the capital losses
-the obsolescence that occurred, first as
the result of the various energy-price shocks,
and later as the result of increased interna-
tional competition and the melting away of
much of the previously existing monopoly
rents to both types of capital. That is actu-
ally bad news. We are not as wealthy as we
thought, but productivity growth, based on
the lower remaining levels of input, is prob-
ably higher than we have measured it.
A cautionary remark needs to be added
here: productivity growth contributes to the
potential for welfare, but it is not the same
thing. Welfare can move in the opposite
direction if the resources released by pro-
ductivity growth do not find adequate em-
ployment in other, economically valuable,
activities (including leisure). Also the physi-
cal, economic, and political environments
can change, both positively and negatively,
overwhelming the productivity story.23 So
even though I have been focusing on it here
tonight, it is not the be-all of economic
welfare. But as George Bernard Shaw used
to say when he was accused of money-grub-
bing: "Yes, I know that money is not happi-
ness, but it is a pretty good substitute."
Nevertheless, the issues I have been dis-
cussing here tonight are important. Much
depends on whether the "truth" is closer to
the upper ("measurable") line in Figure 1,
or the lower one. The country's mood is
affected by bad data and incorrect percep-
tions. Are we really not much better off
than we were in the 1960's? Would we
really like to exchange the commodity as-
sortment we have today for that of
yesteryear? Our health system, warts and
all? The air pollution? The civil-rights situa-
tion? The fear of nuclear war? These are

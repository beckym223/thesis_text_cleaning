One of the great pleasures of belonging to
my generation of economists is that we were
able to witness the birth and the subsequent
evolution of the modern approach to the
analysis of economic growth. The centerpiece
of that approach is probably growth
accounting, but we should never forget that
growth accounting is firmly rooted in economic
theory.
My way of telling the story goes like this:
Many, maybe even most, economists expected
that increments of output would be explained
by increments of inputs, but when we took our
best shot we found that traditional inputs typically
fell far short of explaining the observed
output growth. Our best shot consisted in attributing
to each factor a marginal product
measured by its economic reward. Thus:
(1) ffAy = WAL + (p + 6)AK + R.
Here:
Ay = change in output (GDP);
AL = change in labor input;
p = initial general price level;
w = initial real wage;
T = initial real rate of return to capital;  8 = rate of real depreciation of capital;
AK = change in capital stock; and
R = "the residual" of growth unexplained
by increases in traditional inputs.
Many economists are probably more familiar
with a variant of (1)
(1') (Ay/y)-= (wL/py)(LL/L)
+ [(+ 6)Klfy ] (AK/K)
+ (Rly) = se(AL/L)
+ Sk(AK/K) + (Rly).
In whichever form, the measured residual
typically accounted for an important fraction
of the observed output growth, quite often half
or more.

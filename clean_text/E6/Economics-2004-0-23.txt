system that is less than fully funded will have less
correlation with the returns on private retire-
ment savings, as it adjusts benefits in response
to the growth of tax revenues as well as the  returns on whatever assets are held.80 This com-
parison holds even with initial benefits fully
automatically adjusted for the actuarial position-
returns on assets and the growth of taxable earn-
ings are only partially correlated. Thus portfolio
diversification considerations suggest an advan-
tage to having (at least) some underfunding in
Social Security to complement private savings.
This diversification advantage comes with
the redistribution to earlier cohorts that is inher-
ent in a less than fully funded system.81 Thus
one can readily argue for a Pareto gain (ex ante)
from moving from a fully funded system to a
partially funded system with the risk associated
with the incomplete funding falling on bene-
fits.82 Note that the reverse argument does not
work-just adding funding to an unfunded sys-
tem that provides all of retirement benefits will
not generate a Pareto improvement. The gain
from diversification plays out over time, while
the redistribution required to build up funding
hurts the oldest cohorts who provide the funding
and are affected by the diversification argument
very little or not at all.83 Thus the diversification

argument by itself does not lead to the possibil-
ity of a Pareto gain from adding funding to an
unfunded system, just from reducing funding of
a fully funded defined contribution system.
The comparison above assumed all of the
response in the unfunded system occurred in
benefits. By having some of the response to
aggregate shocks fall on taxes, a less than fully
funded system is capable of doing additional
risk sharing across generations that does not
occur with a fully funded defined contribution
system (Douglas Gale, 1990). Of course how
good a job Congress does in adapting such a
system (whether done automatically or by re-
peated legislation) is a further issue that must be
recognized. Thus, the current system provides
insurance for individual earnings risk through
the progressive benefit formula and the retire-
ment test and provides insurance for aggregate
earnings risk through the defined benefit struc-
ture with less than full funding.
My broad conclusion here is that the absence
of a complete specification of Social Security is
not by itself an argument that there is anything
wrong with our current approach.
VII. Concluding Remarks
Occasionally, I run into people who believe
that no one in his right mind would design a
retirement income system like the one we have.
Some of the details do seem far from satisfac-
tory to me. However, looking at the big picture,
this structure makes sense. Mandated savings
makes sense if you think that many workers
would not provide themselves a reasonable re-
placement rate. This is not just an issue of
avoiding poverty, but one that extends quite far
up the income distribution. Mandating annuiti-
zation makes sense if you think that workers do
not adequately understand the value of annu-
ities. Protection of spouses and children makes
sense if you think that many workers would not
do that adequately. Relating benefits to a mea-
sure of lifetime earnings surely makes sense. A
progressive benefit formula makes sense to pro-
vide higher replacement rates for lower earners,
in order to supplement annual income taxation

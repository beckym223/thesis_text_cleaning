C. Demonstration of the Viability of
Alternative Trade Policies
Research on the contrast between East
Asian and other developing countries and reasons
for it obviously turned out to be a major
contributing factor in influencing thinking
about policy. In a way, research on East Asian
experience provided a final blow to the earlier
uncritical acceptance of the stylized facts. For,
the East Asian experiences demonstrated, as
nothing else could have, the feasibility and viability
of alternative trade policies: it was no
longer possible to associate comparative advantage
with reliance on primary commodity
exports, and the East Asian experience certainly
put an end to the belief that developing
countries could not develop rapidly when relying
on integration with the international
economy.'

The experience of the East Asian exporters
did several things. Most important, it provided
concrete evidence that a developing country
could achieve industrialization without relying
on domestic markets to absorb almost all
additional output. That demonstrated the fallacy
of the earlier view that industrialization
could take place only through import substitution.
45 Also, the East Asian trade regimes offered
significant opportunities for empirical
research, and the evidence mounted that properties
formerly thought to be those of all developing
countries were, in fact, properties
resulting from inner-oriented trade and payments
regimes.

It cannot be said that either research results
or the contrast in economic performance alone
led to the change in policies in other developing
countries.46 Both research (especially
that which brought the sharply contrasting experiences
of the East Asian exporters and the
import-substituting countries into focus) and
experience contributed.

Whether one should regard the East Asian
experience as entirely separate from economic
theory, however, is an interesting question. As
already mentioned, Tsiang (1985) was himself
an international economist, and it was in
significant part his efforts that led the Taiwanese
authorities to abandon inner-oriented
policies and attempt to develop through exports.
The theory of comparative advantage
was, at least in that instance, a pillar on which
policy was built. And, while a variety of factors
no doubt contributed to the Korean adoption
of outer-oriented trade policies after 1960,
the favorable experience of Taiwan undoubtedly
facilitated the willingness of decision
makers to try the new approach.
The East Asian exporters put to rest the
mistaken belief that developing countries relying
on the international market would forever
be specialized in the production of primary
commodities. They also showed that rates
of growth well above those realized even in
the most rapidly growing import-substitution
countries such as Brazil and Turkey could be
realized.

IV. What Lessons Can Be Learned for Research
in New Applied Fields?

It is difficult to draw generalizations based
on the evolution of analysis, empirical research,
and policy in one applied field. Nonetheless,
in the hope that insights from other
applied areas may reinforce or amend the list,
the effort seems worthwhile.
Perhaps the most obvious generalization
from the various factors that have been discussed
is that empirical research which tests
for the presence and order of magnitude of
stylized facts which are used in modelling and

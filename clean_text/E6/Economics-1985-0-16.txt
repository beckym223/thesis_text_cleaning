does not disappear. The new classical economics
simply assumes that structural behavior
is market clearing, and hence claims to be
able to identify the expectational effects of a
particular policy regime. In the absence of
such an a priori assumption, however, how
does one go about separately identifying the
expectational from the structural elements in
wage formation? I do not have the answer.
Conceivably, economics, like physics, is subject
to a fundamental indeterminacy theorem.

I have dealt at some length with the
substance of economists' work and findings
on inflation because mere assertions of
progress would hardly suffice to demonstrate
what's right with economics in this
most vulnerable area. The fact that there
are no final or comprehensive answers
has not kept economists from making
significant distinctions, analyses, and measurements
that equip policy makers with
better means of judging the policy tradeoffs
and determining how to improve the
fit of policy-to-problem for the different
types and stages of inflation. When policy
makers fail to heed these lessons, as in
1974, both the economy and the economist
feel the backlash.
Throughout this discourse, I have time
and again been tempted to kick over the
traces I fastened on myself and give voice
to my own criticisms, dissatisfactions, and
admonitions. But since an unholy (and unwitting)
alliance of my colleagues and outside
critics has amply and ably taken care
of this, I felt it best to stay within my constraints
in the interest of doing what I
could do to redress the balance. As economists,
we have many sins, none deadly,
to confess. But these are far outweighed
by the virtues, all quite lively, that we can
legitimately profess.

understanding economic choice behavior. It al-
ready seems to confirm and explain, however,
that brain structure and chemistry are behind
some systematic anomalies in economic behav-
ior, particularly failures to form perceptions and
pursue self-interest consistently when con-
fronted with choices involving remote, uncer-
tain, or ambiguous outcomes, failures to recall
or anticipate in full color the sensations that
outcomes produce, and the quick adaptation to
circumstance, the hedonic treadmill.
IV. Personal Risk
What information consumes is rather ob-
vious: it consumes the attention of its
recipients. Hence a wealth of information
creates a poverty of attention, and a need
to allocate that attention efficiently among  the overabundance of information sources
that might consume it.  Herbert Simon, 1971
A large literature from behavioral eco-
nomics and psychology finds that people  often make inconsistent choices, fail to
learn from experience, exhibit reluctance  to trade, base their own satisfaction on
how their situation compares with others',
and in other ways depart from the stan-
dard model of the rational economic
agent. If people display bounded ratio-
nality when it comes to maximizing
utility, then their choices do not neces-
sarily reflect their "true" preferences,
and an exclusive reliance on choices to
infer what people desire loses some of
its appeal.

Alan Krueger, forthcoming
The biological evidence that the human brain
is complex and layered, more an imperfect
meeting of minds than an optimizing computer,
follows and supports behavioral evidence from
cognitive psychology and experimental eco-
nomics showing that humans are, well, all too
human in the ways they retrieve and evaluate
information, and process decisions.2 In over-  view, these studies suggest that homo economi-
cus-sovereign in tastes, steely-eyed and
point-on in perception of risk, and relentless in
maximization of happiness-is a rare species.
While consumer behavior in familiar market
settings may have these characteristics, when
we approach the consumer from a different an-
gle, asking direct and unusual questions about
beliefs or values, or offering novel products and
services, we find alarming variations from the
story of consistent advancement of self-interest.
All these apparently normal consumers are re-
vealed to be shells filled with heuristics that
have been shaped by evolutionary selection and
experience. These heuristics often work. For
example, two of my rules which seem success-
ful are: "Never buy a Rolex from a street
vender" and "Never accept an e-mail offer to
transfer millions of dollars to my bank ac-
count." However, throw the consumer a curve
ball, in the form of a question that fails to fit a
standard heuristic for market response, and the
essential "irrationality" of the organism is re-
vealed. For most economists, this is the plot line
for "Stepford Consumers," a real horror movie.
Even if this bleak portrayal is true, however, it
does not mean that policy conclusions based on
consumer rationality are wrong, only that the
consumer may need to be coaxed and wheedled
into responding to market choices with suffi-
cient diligence to approximate rational promo-  tion of self-interest.
Most of the evidence on consumer decision-
making comes from laboratory experiments.
Economists reviewing the experimental evi-
dence sometimes comment that markets punish
inconsistencies, and consumers learn to avoid
them. They then conclude that while these flaws
may appear in experiments, they are not impor-
tant for economic behavior. This may be true in
repeated, familiar market settings where the
conduct and rewards of others provide good

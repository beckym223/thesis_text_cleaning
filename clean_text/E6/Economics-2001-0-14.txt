and has been used in almost all applications of
the cost of capital.25

The second empirical issue is the measurement
of economic depreciation. The stability of
patterns of depreciation in the face of changes in
tax policy and price shocks has been carefully
documented. The depreciation rates presented
by Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000b) summarize a
large body of empirical research on the behavior
of asset prices.2 A third empirical issue is the
description of the tax structure for capital income.
This depends on the tax laws prevailing
at each point of time. The resolution of these
issues has cleared the way for detailed measurements
of the cost of capital for all assets that
appear in the national accounts, including information
technology.27

The definition of capital includes all tangible
assets in the U.S. economy, equipment and
structures, as well as consumers' and government
durables, land, and inventories. The capital
service flows from durable goods employed
by households and governments enter measures
of both output and input. A steadily rising proportion
of these service flows are associated
with investments in IT. Investments in IT by
business, household, and government sectors
must be included in the GDP, along with household
and government IT capital services, in
order to capture the full impact of IT on the U.S.
economy.

Table 3 gives capital stocks from 1948 to
1999, as well as price indexes for total domestic
tangible assets and IT assets-computers, software,
and communications equipment. The estimate
of domestic tangible capital stock in
Table 3 is $35.4 trillions in 1999, considerably
greater than the $27.9 trillions in fixed capital
estimated by Shelby W. Herman (2000) of
BEA. The most important differences reflect the
inclusion of inventories and land in Table 3.
Business IT investments, as well as purchases
of computers, software, and communications
equipment by households and governments,
have grown spectacularly in recent years, but
remain relatively small. The stocks of all IT
assets combined account for only 4.35 percent
of domestic tangible capital stock in 1999. Table
4 presents estimates of the flow of capital
services and corresponding price indexes for
1948-1999.

The difference between growth in capital services
and capital stock is the improvement in
capital quality. This represents the substitution
towards assets with higher marginal products.
The shift toward IT increases the quality of
capital, since computers, software, and communications
equipment have relatively high marginal
products. Capital stock estimates fail to
account for this increase in quality and substantially
underestimate the impact of IT investment
on growth.

The growth of capital quality is slightly less
than 20 percent of capital input growth for the
period 1948-1995. However, improvements in
capital quality have increased steadily in relative
importance. These improvements jumped
to 44.9 percent of total growth in capital input
during the period 1995-1999, reflecting very
rapid restructuring of capital to take advantage
of the sharp acceleration in the IT price decline.
Capital stock has become progressively less accurate
as a measure of capital input and is now
seriously deficient.

Figure 5 gives the IT capital service flows as
a share of gross domestic income. The second
panel of Table 2 summarizes the growth rates of
prices and quantities of capital inputs for 1990-
1995 and 1995-1999. Growth of IT capital services
jumps from 11.51 percent per year in
1990-1995 to 19.41 percent in 1995-1999,
while growth of non-IT capital services increases
from 1.72 percent to 2.94 percent. This
reverses the trend toward slower capital growth
through 1995.

focused on average rates of return and on
"necessary conditions," using what I be-
lieve to be very widely shared assumptions
as to the meaning of low and of high valu-
ation of controversial nonmarket contribu-
tions.
At this point, attention should be di-
rected at those aspects of our problem
which call for highly subjective judgment.
My illustrations will be found in Appendix
D, which contains observations on signifi-
cant structural and allocational problems
within the area of R & D. Prominent
among these problems is that of "concen-
tration" in several senses of this term. As
for educational policy, it has become all too
obvious that the future of Western civili-
zation depends on the personal attitudes
millions of individuals will develop to
structural problems belonging in that sec-
tor of the progress-generating activities.
We may now return to our point of de-
parture. As long as we want to remain on a
level of reasonable objectivity, we can only
try to play into the hands of those who
must make their own value judgments. On
alternative cost-bases it is possible to make
reasonable statements of fairly general
validity on the social profitability of the
progress-generating activities as a whole
and on the trends of this profitability. For
the time being the average social yields
are high on both our cost-bases, very much
higher than 13 percent and 18 percent,
respectively, as was seen. It should of
course not be overlooked that a waiting
period of considerable duration elapses be-
tween some progress-generating inputs and
the onset of their yield. But this is true
only of part of the progress-inputs as we
have defined them. Furthermore, when
comparing these yields with yields from
plhysical capital formation, another lag-
adjustment is also needed, and as ex-
plained in Appendix A, this works in the
opposite direction (in favor of the progress-
inputs). We should remember also that
while on the one hand the lag between
progress-inputs and their results would call
for upward revaluation of the inputs in
relation to their results, on the other hand,
earlier progress-inputs have all along been
smaller progress-inputs.
At any event, regardless of what lag-
adjustment we make within reason, the
average social rate of return-even the
rate on the all-inclusive cost-base-satis-
fies our necessary condition with ease. This
"real rate" is at present much higher than
the marginal rate from physical invest-
ment at a more or less given level of knowl-
edge. The latter rate should be estimated
at less than 10 percent; a good case can be
made for estimating it at a figure located
in the range between 5 percent and 10 per-
cent.46 Moreover, the rates on progress-
inputs suggested by our analysis are ap-
preciably higher also than the typical pre-
tax corporate profit-rates, a fact which is
worth noting even though no comparabil-
ity is claimed for our rates of return with
accounting profits.47

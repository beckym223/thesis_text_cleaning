we have seen and emphasized might simply
be the result of errors of observations? This
is by no means a frivolous question. For one
can actually create frequency distributions
of rates of TFP increase which contain ex-
actly the same information as the sunrise-
sunset diagrams previously presented. The
only trick is to count as the unit of frequency
not one firm (out of an industry aggregate)
or one industry (out of some larger aggre-
gate) but, instead, say, 1 percent of the total
value added of the aggregate. Thus a firm
with 20 percent of the value added of an in-
dustry would appear with 10 times the
weight of a firm accounting for 2 percent of
the value added of that industry. In such a
chart, the cumulative frequency (say, 68 per-
cent) above ATFP = 0 would represent the
projection on the horizontal axis of the
maximum point on a sunrise diagram. Its

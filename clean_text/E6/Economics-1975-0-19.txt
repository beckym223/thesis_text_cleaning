economic policy, capped by the tax cut,
was the major force holding the postwar
economy on a vastly higher plane than
the prewar economy.5 On one hand, the
high employment, limited-recession econ-
omy forged with our macro-economic
policy tools is indeed an inflation-prone
economy the formula for successful man-
agement of high-pressure prosperity is far
more elusive than the formula for getting
there. Yet on the other hand, success bred
great expectations on the part of the public
that economics could deliver prosperity
without inflation and with ever-growing
material gains in the bargain. The message
got through that we had "harnessed the
existing economics . . . to the purposes of
prosperity, stability, and growth," and
that as to the role of the tax cut in break-
ing old molds of thinking, "nothing suc-
ceeds like success" (Heller). The Economist
unkindly corrected me: "Nothing exceeds
like success."6
To be sure, critics and converts alike
ignored our caveats that the goal of
"prosperity without a price-wage spiral"
had "eluded not only this country but all  of its industrial partners in the free world,"
that "the margin for error diminishes as
the economy reaches the treasured but
treacherous area of full employment. . .
and that "the 'new economics' promises
no money-back guarantees against occa-
sional slowdowns or even recessions"
(Heller).
All too soon, Vietnam blew the economy
off-course. Economists found that in the
political arena fiscal policy was not a two-
way street and that the much delayed sur-
tax adopted in mid-1968 was no match for
surging inflation. Nor was the induced re-
cession of 1969-70. It took a combination
of the 1971 shock therapy of tight wage-
price controls and the stimulus of tax cuts
to subdue inflation and energize expansion.
It is worth noting that economists an-
alyzed and projected the effects of this
''new economic policy" with exceptional
precision. That the tax cuts, coupled with
controls and devaluation, would generate a
surging expansion at very moderate rates
of inflation in .1972 was widely and ac-
curately forecast.
But the period from August 1971 to
January 1973 was in the nature of a re-
mission from the inflationary disease,
clearly not a cure. The 1969-70 recession
brought home the worsening problem of
persistent inflation in the face of slow-
down and recession. It presented new
empirical puzzles for the analysts of the
Phillips curve, wage equations, and expec-
tational inflation. And it began to prompt
the public mutterings that are being in-
tensified by the 1974-75 stagflation: "All
right, so you did not promise us a rose
garden without thorns-but the thorns
without the rose garden?"
Keenly aware of these problems, econo-
mists have long been at the drawing
boards on this problem of endemic infla-
tion. In a close parallel with research on
cancer, economists are working on various
pieces of the inflation puzzle and produc-

should. Serious students, however, offer
widely different estimates of the contribu-
tions of other factors: the quality of school-
ing, conventional capital services, R&D, and
the influence of cyclical or other forces af-
fecting intensity of resource use. The impact
of higher energy prices on the substitution
of labor for capital in the operation of exist-
ing energy-using equipment and on the
post-1973 slowdown of capital deepening is
equally unclear, though possibly very im-
portant. Most analyses leave a substantial
part of the retardation unconnected with
any identified and measured contributory
source, and they disagree about the time-
whether after 1973 or as early as the latter
1960's-when that unspecified residual re-
tardation made its appearance.'2
In this state of factual uncertainty, it is
not hard to propose estimates of the sources
of retardation which assign substantial re-
sponsibility to factors connected with the
government's welfare and regulatory activi-
ties. We, therefore, find William Fellner ask-
ing: "...whether, directly or indirectly [the
analyses of the retardation] do not suggest
that the weakening of the productivity trend
is attributable in part to changes in the
socio-political environment that are of re-
cent origin or that have cumulated to a
'critical mass"' (p. 4).
The suggested mode of operation of these
factors is, first, through a decline in the rate
of capital deepening; second, through a de-
cline of worker effort symptomized by ab-
senteeism and by a drop in hours worked
relative to hours paid; third, by a disinclina-
tion for risky, innovatory effort, whose
manifestation is the observed slowdown in
the residual measures of total factor produc-
tivity growth; and fourth, through the diver-
sion of resources to regulatory compliance,
the benefits of which do not register in
measured output even when they should.
These sources of retardation whether great
or small-the "suspects," as Fellner calls
them-are arguably associated with char-
acteristic features of our mixed economy,
even if they are not exclusively due to them.
The first of those features is the widening
difference between before- and after-tax
marginal rates of return to work, saving,
investment, and risk taking. The magnitude
of the rise in these rates is indicated by the
overall increase of total government ex-
penditures from 20 percent of GNP in
1947-49 to 28 percent in 1963-65 and again
to over 32 percent in 1977-79.13 The incen-
tive effects of the tax increases are still im-
perfectly understood, but there is little
reason to suppose they are not distinctly
unfavorable.'4 Allied to the effects of rising
tax burdens is the possible effect of the
cumulating "social security wealth" of indi-
viduals on savings and that of other in-
surance and income-support programs on
work.'5 Next, there are the effects of bur-
geoning regulatory activity. These go be-
yond the direct resource costs of compliance
already mentioned. There are also indirect
costs and risks of obtaining administrative
and judicial clearance for new projects, the
diversion of R&D expenditure to meet en-
vironmental and safety standards, and the
hazards of possible future changes in regula-
tory requirements. Finally, there are the
manifold effects of erratic and accelerating
inflation.

makes benefits a progressive function of life-
time earnings offers insurance about lifetime
earnings that is not available in the market.
If the taxes and benefits for a cohort broke
even in present value terms, the use of a pro-
gressive benefit formula would imply that the
labor supplies of lower earners were being sub-
sidized and those of higher earners were being
taxed.45 This is the familiar pattern with insur-
ance with asymmetric information-a combina-
tion of insurance and incentives neither of
which satisfy the conditions for first-best opti-
mization. This effect of progressivity is in
addition to the effects from annuity pricing dis-
cussed above. Some of the effects of annuitiza-
tion and progressivity would be offsetting-
those with higher earnings of each gender tend
to live longer-and some would be compound-
ing-women on average have lower earnings
and longer lives. That taxes and benefits do not
break even on a cohort basis is discussed in the
next section.
The progressivity in the benefit formula uses
taxes that distort labor supply in order to redis-
tribute income and provide insurance. The pro-
gressive annual income tax also redistributes
income, provides insurance against earnings un-
certainty, and distorts labor supply. Since these  two institutions work on different tax bases and
provide payments at different times, there is
room for each of them to contribute despite the
presence of the other. Annual income taxation
recognizes short-term needs, coming from bor-
rowing constraints and from behavior that is not
time-consistent. It also recognizes capital in-
come as part of determining tax rates. Ex post,
all of one's Social Security taxable earnings (in
the best 35 years) contributed to benefits in a
way that varies with age but not with the level
of annual earnings, given lifetime earnings.
This avoids the distortions coming from having
different marginal tax rates in different years as
a function of annual earnings, or annual capital
income. The use of a lifetime measure also
separates out issues of lifetime earnings from
the age-earnings profile in doing redistribu-

tion.46 While both annual income taxation and
lifetime social security have received analyses
of the trade-off among redistribution, insurance,
and distortions, there has not been much work
considering the simultaneous use of both  institutions.
A. Retirement Test
For a mandate to save for later consumption
to have bite, workers can not be allowed to
claim benefits whenever they want, including
immediately. To claim Social Security retire-
ment benefits, a worker must be at least 62. The
system could simply start paying benefits at age
62. Instead, between age 62 and the age for full
benefits, workers can only start receiving bene-
fits if their current earnings are low enough,
corresponding to full or partial retirement for
many workers.47 Any delay in the start of ben-
efits increases their monthly amount, tending to
counterbalance the delay in the start of benefits.
The impact of this retirement test on labor mar-
ket incentives is in addition to effects discussed
above that apply to each year of labor supply.
That is, the effect of Social Security on incen-
tives for continued work past age 62 has two
parts. One is the effect of a delay in the start of
benefits together with their later increase as a
consequence of the delay in their start.48 The

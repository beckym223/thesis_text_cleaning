edge.' Even what in the usual neoclassical
model is considered mere factor-substitu-
tion is in this alternative framework viewed
as implying the invention of new types of
goods, viz. of less labor-intensive equip-
ment. I will explain later why I will
merely keep an eye on the conclusions ob-
tainable from this construction which is
neither neoclassical nor Cambridgeian,
and why the main part of my analysis
will move in the framework usually re-
ferred to as neoclassical.2 Objections raised
against the neoclassical models are quite
inconclusive in their present form, be-
cause the question is not whether the as-
sumptions underlying such models are
"'realistic" (a good photograph of reality),
but whether in the real world these as-
sumptions are violated in such respects
and to such an extent as to render the
analytical results misleading. This the cri-
tics have so far not even tried to show.
I. A Ratio of Benefit-Streamt to Cost and the
Corresponding Average Social
Rate of Return
The costs of generating progress consist
of the costs of producing new knowledge,
and the costs of increased per-capita knowl-
edge-distribution, and of the extra-costs of
chiangeovers from the use of old to the use of
new knowledge. This seems a reasonable
way of looking at our problem, because
if knowledge in use remained constant
per capita, the rate of progress would be

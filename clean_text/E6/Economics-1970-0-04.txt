Even what in the usual neoclassical
model is considered mere factor-substitution
is in this alternative framework viewed
as implying the invention of new types of
goods, viz. of less labor-intensive equipment.
I will explain later why I will
merely keep an eye on the conclusions obtainable
from this construction which is
neither neoclassical nor Cambridgeian,
and why the main part of my analysis
will move in the framework usually referred
to as neoclassical.2 Objections raised
against the neoclassical models are quite
inconclusive in their present form, because
the question is not whether the assumptions
underlying such models are
"'realistic" (a good photograph of reality),
but whether in the real world these assumptions
are violated in such respects
and to such an extent as to render the
analytical results misleading. This the critics
have so far not even tried to show.
I. A Ratio of Benefit-Streamt to Cost and the
Corresponding Average Social
Rate of Return
The costs of generating progress consist
of the costs of producing new knowledge,
and the costs of increased per-capita knowledge-
distribution, and of the extra-costs of
chiangeovers from the use of old to the use of
new knowledge. This seems a reasonable
way of looking at our problem, because
if knowledge in use remained constant
per capita, the rate of progress would be

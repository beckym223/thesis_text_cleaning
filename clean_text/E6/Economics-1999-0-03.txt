I. Some Implications of Technophysio Evolution
The rapid acceleration in technological
change is apparent in the decline in mortality
rates during the twentieth century. Study of the
causes of this decline point to the existence of
a synergism between technological and physiological
improvements that has produced a
form of human evolution that is biological but
not genetic, rapid, culturally transmitted, and
not necessarily stable. This process, which is
still ongoing in both rich and developing
countries, has been called "technophysio
evolution."
Unlike the genetic theory of evolution
through natural selection, which applies to the
whole history of life on earth, technophysio
evolution applies only to the last 300 years of
human history, and particularly to the last century.
Despite its limited scope, technophysio
evolution appears to be relevant to forecasting
likely trends over the next century or so in longevity,
the age of onset of chronic diseases,
body size, and the efficiency and durability of
vital organ systems. It also has a bearing on
such pressing issues of public policy as the
growth in population, in pension costs, and in
health-care costs (Fogel and Dora L. Costa,
1997).
Technophysio evolution implies that human
beings now have so great a degree of control
over their environment that they are set apart
not only from all other species, but also from
all previous generations of Homo sapiens.

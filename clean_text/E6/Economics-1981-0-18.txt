1. The official measures count the number of persons living below constant real (that is, inflation-adjusted) poverty
lines defined for households with different characteristics. The adjusted figures correct the official figures for
underreporting of income and, in the posttransfer estimates, for direct taxes and for receipts of transfers in kind. To
obtain the relative measures, the authors "set the relative poverty lines equal to the federal ones [in 1965]. In
succeeding years, the relative lines are increased at the same rate as the median income" (p. 258).

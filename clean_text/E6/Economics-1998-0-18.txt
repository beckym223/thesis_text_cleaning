were to quit earlier in response to a challenge
that turns out to be deadly. But they do not
recognize the challenge as deadly, so they
keep struggling to survive. I believe this is part
of the nature of entrepreneurs, CEOs, and
business leaders in general. They would not be
where they are, doing what they are doing, if
they were ready to quit at the first sign of a
challenge. They are fighters by nature, and
they probably would not have achieved suc-
cess if they were not.
Firms with negative TFP growth may even
be innovators. New challenges come and dif-
ferent firms think of different ways to respond
to them. Some (like Intel and Microsoft) end
up winners; others (Montgomery Ward and
Apple?) end up losing. But it may not be that
they just waited passively and tried to fight to
survive in the face of negative shocks. They
may have had quite innovative ideas, with de-
cent prior probabilities of success, but in the
end success did not come. Thus, negative TFP
performance can, and I believe often does,
come simply from "backing the wrong horse."
To me, Joseph A. Schlumpeter's vision
(1934) of "creative destruction" captures
much of the story. What he is saying is, yes,
it's a jungle out there, but the processes of that
jungle are at the core of the dynamics of a
market-oriented economy. They are what got
us to where we are, and they hold the best
promise for further progress in the future.2
In my opinion, Schumpeter saw through to
the essence of the problerrm, but it is not wise
for us to be fatalistic in accepting his vision.
We cannot lose by making a major effort to
understand the process of TFP improvement
where it happens-at the level of the firm.
This is all the more true because of the

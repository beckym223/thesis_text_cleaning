Viner says:
For all these reasons, ... there is in the
abstract no reason for making an idol
of the welfare state in its American
form or for dedicating ourselves unre-
servedly to its continuance as it is to-
day without qualification or amend-
ment. Given the... imperfection of the
procedures whereby it deals with prob-
lems which it cannot evade or defer or
with problems which special interests
may press upon it for premature reso-
lution, it would be only by the dis-
pensation of a benevolent Providence
that it would ever make precisely the
right decisions or always avoid major
mistakes. It does not have theoretical
superiority over all conceivable alter-
native systems.... If ... I nevertheless
conclude that I believe that the welfare
state, like old Siwash, is really worth
fighting for and even dying for as
compared to any rival system, it is
because, despite its imperfections in
theory and in practice, in the aggre-
gate it provides more promise of pre-
serving and enlarging human free-
doms, temporal prosperity, the extinc-
tion of mass misery, and the dignity of
man and his moral improvement than
any other social system which has pre-
viously prevailed, which prevails
elsewhere today or which, outside
Utopia, the mind of man has been
able to provide a blueprint for.

Viner says:
For all these reasons, ... there is in the
abstract no reason for making an idol
of the welfare state in its American
form or for dedicating ourselves unreservedly
to its continuance as it is today
without qualification or amendment.
Given the... imperfection of the
procedures whereby it deals with problems
which it cannot evade or defer or
with problems which special interests
may press upon it for premature resolution,
it would be only by the dispensation
of a benevolent Providence
that it would ever make precisely the
right decisions or always avoid major
mistakes. It does not have theoretical
superiority over all conceivable alternative
systems.... If ... I nevertheless
conclude that I believe that the welfare
state, like old Siwash, is really worth
fighting for and even dying for as
compared to any rival system, it is
because, despite its imperfections in
theory and in practice, in the aggregate
it provides more promise of preserving
and enlarging human freedoms,
temporal prosperity, the extinction
of mass misery, and the dignity of
man and his moral improvement than
any other social system which has previously
prevailed, which prevails
elsewhere today or which, outside
Utopia, the mind of man has been
able to provide a blueprint for.

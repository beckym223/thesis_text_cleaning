guesswork (I believe of a plausible kind),
but it may be regarded as a fact that 13
percent and 18 percent understate the
average rate of progress-return by a sub-
stantial margin and this will prove signifi-
cant for the present analysis.
The second statement I consider to be
reasonably safe is that the rates of return
show some degree of downward tendency
in the long run (see here also Appendix B).
The qualifications one might want to add
to this statement are not sufficiently
persuasive to arouse much suspicion in the
diagnosis that such a tendency is observ-
able, though I would not want to assert
that my figures give an accurate idea of
the extent to which a downtrend has mani-
fested itself. On what I defined as the re-
duced cost-base this downward tendency
has been very mild, but it would not
entirely disappear on any cost-base that to
me seems reasonably chosen.
The suggestion of a long-run downward
tendency of the average rate of return is
not misleading, because the long-run in-
crease of the costs of progress-inputs has
all along exceeded the rise of the produc-
tivity-gains when both are expressed in
relation to the same output-base. In par-
ticular, the approximately constant up-
trend of productivity during the post-war
decades has been associated with increas-
ing progress-costs even if we consider
merely the costs of the privately financed
progress-inputs. The second half of the
present decade does not fit well into the
pattern, but it is too early to try to inter-
pret the record of the very recent infla-
tionary years, not only because the rate of
resource-utilization in the American econ-
omy has risen suddenly but also because
the rate of increase of the progress-inputs
has been tapering off. This tapering off
occurred partly because the rate of in-
crease of space research tapered off and
then space research reached a peak in 1966;
and partly because even more recently
there also took place anti-inflationary
downward revisions of government pro-
grams (which is not to say that the rate of
increase of R & D might not have declined
even aside from these circumstances).
Consequently it is to early to ask whether
in the mid-sixties the downward tendency
of our benefit-cost ratios was or was not
interrupted, but further productivity-
increases would have to assume a very
unlikely course to invalidate the conclu-
sion that there did occur some degree of
long-run decline, even with reasonable
allowances for lags.
We should note that the downward
tendency of the progress-yields would be
slightly smaller than our figures suggest if
we assumed a small rise of the rate of
increase of factor productivity from 1953
to 1966. In fact there is valid reason for
assuming a small acceleration of progress
but, as concerns the downward tendency
of the yields, allowance for this would
make little difference, because such a
modification would call at the same time
for a small increase of our charge for the
unrecorded costs.42

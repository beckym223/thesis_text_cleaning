The elasticity of taxable labor income with
respect to the net-of-tax share, i.e., to one minus
the marginal tax rate on labor income, is much
greater than the traditional elasticity of labor
supply as measured by labor force participation
and average hours worked. Estimating this elas-
ticity is now a subject of very active research
among public finance economists. Although a
wide range of estimates has been produced,
some studies are more reliable than others. I
believe that a conservative estimate is that the
compensated elasticity of taxable income with
respect to the net-of-tax rate is one-half.
Using this elasticity and the 2004 taxable
payroll implies that a rise in the effective mar-
ginal tax rate from 37.7 percent to 44.2 percent
increases the annual deadweight loss by $96
billion, or nearly one percent of GDP.11 Since
the 6.5-percent increase in the marginal tax rate
applies only to taxable labor income (about 40
percent of GDP), the deadweight loss is equal to
about one-third of the incremental tax revenue.
Even this understates the relative size of the
deadweight loss because it ignores the reduction
in the tax base and therefore in the tax revenue
that results from the higher marginal tax. When
that reduction in taxable income is taken into
account, the incremental deadweight loss is
nearly 50 percent of the incremental revenue.12
The true cost per additional dollar of payroll tax
revenue is therefore $1.50.
Note that this is just the deadweight loss or
excess burden-i.e., the pure waste-associated  with the incremental tax. It does not include the
deadweight loss of the existing tax or the direct
burden of the taxes themselves. And it does not
include the deadweight loss caused by the pro-
gram distortions.
Although scaling back the rise in future ben-
efits would reduce the increase in the dead-
weight loss, it would also reduce the protection
that Social Security provides to future retirees.
An alternative approach is therefore to redesign
the program so that the increased financing re-
quired for the aging population has less of the
character of a tax.
One way to do that is to strengthen the tax-
payers perception of the link between taxes paid
and future benefits. That is one of the advan-
tages of shifting from the existing complicated
defined benefit rules to a defined contribution
system, even to a notional defined contribution
system. Although a notional defined contribu-
tion plan would remain a pay-as-you-go system,
it would clearly link each worker's social insur-
ance tax payment to his or her resulting future  benefits.
A defined contribution system would provide
a tax-benefit link for those groups in the popu-
lation that now receive no extra benefits at all in
exchange for their additional taxes. For them,
the Social Security payroll tax is a pure tax just
like the income tax. These include both young
and older workers who are not in the top 35
wage-indexed earning years of their life, the
basis on which Social Security benefits are cal-
culated, as well as working women who will
eventually claim benefits based on their hus-
bands' earnings.
Although an unfunded notional defined con-
tribution system would provide some remedy,
the very low implicit rate of return in an un-
funded system implies that the payroll tax
would retain much of its distorting character. A
pay-as-you-go plan that substitutes a 2-percent
real return for private saving that would other-
wise earn a 5-percent real return is equivalent
over a lifetime of saving and dissaving to a tax
rate of about 75 percent.13

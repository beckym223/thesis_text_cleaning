which would require insurance companies to
cover all applicants regardless of health condition
with no premium surcharge for the sick, the
health economists are evenly divided: 51 percent
agree and 49 percent disagree. Among economic
theorists there is slightly more agreement on
policy, but not as much as among practicing
physicians who, contrary to both groups of economists,
show more agreement on policy-value
than on positive questions.
The contrasts between the replies by group
and type of question are brought more sharply
into focus in Table 2, which shows the average
absolute difference between the percentage
agreeing and the percentage disagreeing.
Among health economists the extent of consensus
for the positive questions is significantly
larger than for the policy-value
questions regardless of whether the comparison
is between means or medians. Although
the sample sizes are very small (7 and 13 ), the
differences by type of question are so large we
can reject the null hypothesis with considerable
confidence.27
It is also worth noting that the extent of
agreement among health economists on the
positive questions is much higher than is usually
found in surveys of economists covering
a wide variety of fields. For example, in a
survey conducted by Richard M. Alston et al.
(1992) the authors identify ten questions as
"micro-positive" and seven as "micronormative.
"28 In order to achieve comparability
between their survey and mine, I
combined their "agree, with provisos" with
their "agree," and then calculated the mean
absolute difference between percentage agreeing
and percentage disagreeing.29 This difference
(22 percentage points) was much smaller
(and less statistically significant) than the difference
I found for the health economists.

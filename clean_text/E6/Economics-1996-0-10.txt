which would require insurance companies to
cover all applicants regardless of health condi-
tion with no premium surcharge for the sick, the
health economists are evenly divided: 51 percent
agree and 49 percent disagree. Among economic
theorists there is slightly more agreement on
policy, but not as much as among practicing
physicians who, contrary to both groups of econ-
omists, show more agreement on policy-value
than on positive questions.
The contrasts between the replies by group
and type of question are brought more sharply
into focus in Table 2, which shows the ave-
rage absolute difference between the percent-
age agreeing and the percentage disagreeing.
Among health economists the extent of con-
sensus for the positive questions is sig-
nificantly larger than for the policy-value
questions regardless of whether the compari-
son is between means or medians. Although
the sample sizes are very small (7 and 13 ), the
differences by type of question are so large we
can reject the null hypothesis with consider-
able confidence.27
It is also worth noting that the extent of
agreement among health economists on the
positive questions is much higher than is usu-
ally found in surveys of economists covering
a wide variety of fields. For example, in a
survey conducted by Richard M. Alston et al.
(1992) the authors identify ten questions as
"micro-positive" and seven as "micro-
normative."28 In order to achieve compar-
ability between their survey and mine, I
combined their "agree, with provisos" with
their "agree," and then calculated the mean
absolute difference between percentage agree-
ing and percentage disagreeing.29 This differ-
ence (22 percentage points) was much smaller
(and less statistically significant) than the dif-
ference I found for the health economists.
27 This was confirmed by Byron Wm. Brown, who ex-
amined the data using the bootstrap method (Bradley
Efron, 1993).  28 The identification is in a longer, unpublished version
of their paper.  29 I also tried treating "agree, with provisos" as "no
opinion"; this reduced the difference between the positive
and normative questions with respect to consensus.
30 Comparisons based on the entropy index used by
Alston et al. (1992) are even more striking. The mean
entropy (a measure of lack of consensus) was 0.70 for their
micro-positive questions, but only 0.52 for the health
economists' answers to our positive questions. The mean
for their micro-normative questions (0.80) was just about

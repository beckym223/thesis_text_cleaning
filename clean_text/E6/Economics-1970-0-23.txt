A downtrend of rates of return in the
progress-generating activities is, of course,
not the same phenomenon as the previously
discussed gap between the average
and the marginal rate on the progressinputs
of single periods; the downtrend
over time calls for a different interpretation.
It may be interpreted as meaning
that researchers, teachers and other workers
engaged in knowledge-acquisition and
distribution activities of growing complexity
have increased the efficiency of their
own group somewhat less than would have
been required for unchanging performance
at unchanging costs. Even the relativevaluation
(or relative-wage) component of
a downtrend can in good part be so interpreted,
because while this component
becomes enlarged by rent-formation, it
nevertheless is true that the relative increase
of the incomes of progress-workers
typically results from the need to use very
highly qualified personnel on a rising
scale."' Trying to avoid a downtrend
of the rates of return on these particular
inputs by limiting the scale of the progressactivies
of each successive period accordingly
would in the long run prove incompatible
with a nondiminishing rate of technological
advance in the economy at large.
In view of the scarcity of the ultimate resources
needed for any economic processincluding
the process of self-improvement
of progress-workers-a secular downward
tendency of yields should indeed be expected,
and Kenneth Arrow was right in
reminding us at last year's annual meeting
that "eternal exponential technological
growth is just as unreasonable as eternal
exponential population growth."44 But it is
equally true and important that such a
slow, secular downward tendency of the
progress-yields may become interrupted
for very long periods. Recurring "breakthroughs"
play an important role in the
history of the sciences.
Quite aside from the question of a downward
tendency with the actually observed
composition of the progress-activities, we
should recall that, given the present scale
of these activities, even a person in full
agreement with the community-decisions
concerning composition would in all probability
have to consider the marginal social
rates of return of each period lower than
our average rates. This gap arises partly
because high-quality personnel is limited,
and partly because the solution of problems
presupposes the solution of earlier ones.
The least promising project of any period
is apt to be appreciably less promising
than the period's average project. But as
I said in Section II, I am abstaining here
from efforts to apply formal analysis to the
problem of marginal rates, since each individual
is entitled to his own marginal
calculus and in most of the area in which
this paper has been moving individual
valuations become submerged in compromise
rather than become validated at the
margin by means of purchase, sale and
production.45 This is why I have so far

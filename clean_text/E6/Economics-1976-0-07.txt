conventional micro-economic theory as it
has developed, particularly in the last
seventy-five years or so, takes a normative
stance by default.9 Indeed, it takes a
normative stance by more than default. It
says outright that the primary question to
which economists should address themselves
is the "optimum" allocation of resources,
and it insists on providing a precise
definition of optimum. (Compare
Ward, pp. 52-54, 90.) Since, as Koopmans
points out, competitive equilibrium theory
ignores the welfare implications of the personal
distribution of income that results,
"the term 'optimum' [is] a misnomer"
(p. 49). (See also Ward, pp. 197-98.)
My remarks thus far have been directed
toward microeconomics. But macro-economic
analysis also must face the problem
of how optimally to combine rigor and
relevance. What we today call macroeconomics
grew out of the catastrophe of
the Great Depression,'0 and in the early
development of macro-economic analysis
relevance took precedence over rigor. Today,
rigor competes with relevance in
macro-economic and monetary theory, and
in some lines of development macro and
monetary theorists, like many of their colleagues
in micro theory, seem to consider
relevance to be more or less irrelevant. A
good example has been the elaboration of
so-called growth theory Ahich now seems
to be losing some of its earlier popularity.
Apparently, there has come to be a growing
recognition that the considerable efforts
spent on growth models have not significantly
advanced knowledge beyond the
contributions of the original Harrod-Domar
and the Solow-Swan neoclassical models.
And other intriguing topics have arisen to
stimulate the pursuit of rigor at the expense
of relevance.

In both micro- and macroeconomics, efforts
are sometimes made to extract a drop
or two of relevance from exercises in analytical
rigor; and conclusions are drawn
about the functioning of some aspect of
the real world, or policy recommendations
are made, on the basis of theoretical exercises
which rest on assumptions that fly in
the face of the facts. One example is the
frequent fitting of the neoclassical investment
function, with its built-in assumptions
of constant returns and perfect competition,
to industries in which these assumptions
obviously do not hold. Another
example is a good deal of the recent literature
seeking to reformulate the microeconomic
foundations of macro-economic
theory and policy-what Edmund Phelps
(1969, 1972) has termed "The New Microeconomics
in Inflation and Employment
Theory." The theoretical analysis in much
of this literature rests on assumptions that
also fly in the face of the facts. To cite a
few examples: all unemployment is a voluntary
activity as part of a search procedure
in which workers are continuously
equating costs and prospective benefits at
the margin; the labor supply is typically
taken to be homogeneous with perfect mobility
among labor submarkets; so-called
structural unemployment is ignored as are
the striking differences in unemployment
rates among different age, sex, ethnic, and
occupational groups; and downward wage
flexibility is generally assumed, although
some recent attempts have been made to
relax this assumption. Another related recent
development in which theory proceeds
with impeccable logic from unrealistic
assumptions to conclusions that contradict
the historical record, is the recent
work on rational expectations. (Compare
Robert J. Gordon.) And, as a final illustration
I might cite much of the recent literature
on capital theory.

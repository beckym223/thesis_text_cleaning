E. Communications Equipment and Software
Communications technology is crucial for the
rapid development and diffusion of the Internet,
perhaps the most striking manifestation of in-
formation technology in the American econ-
omy.15 Kenneth Flamm (1989) was the first to
compare the behavior of computer prices and
the prices of communications equipment. He
concluded that the communications equipment
prices fell only a little more slowly than com-
puter prices. Gordon (1990) compared Flamm's
results with the official price indexes, revealing
substantial bias in the official indexes.
Communications equipment is an important
market for semiconductors, but constant quality
price indexes cover only a portion of this equip-
ment. Switching and terminal equipment rely
heavily on semiconductor technology, so that
product development reflects improvements in
semiconductors. Grimm's (1997) constant qual-
ity price index for digital telephone switching
equipment, given in Figure 3, was incorporated
into the national accounts in 1996. The output
of communications services in the NIPA also
incorporates a constant quality price index for
cellular phones.
Much communications investment takes the
form of the transmission gear, connecting data,
voice, and video terminals to switching equip-
ment. Technologies such as fiber optics, micro-
wave broadcasting, and communications satellites
have progressed at rates that outrun even the dra-
matic pace of semiconductor development. An
example is dense wavelength division multiplex-
ing (DWDM), a technology that sends multiple
signals over an optical fiber simultaneously. In-
stallation of DWDM equipment, beginning in
1997, has doubled the transmission capacity of
fiber-optic cables every 6-12 months.'6

nology and provides a general reference on fiber optics.

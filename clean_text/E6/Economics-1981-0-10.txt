Inflation belongs in this litany because
our pursuit of alternative welfare goals has
thus far also involved a tolerance, indeed a
pressure, for chronic budgetary deficits, and
an understandable political incapacity to
employ monetary and fiscal restraint force-
fully and consistently at the risk of elevated
unemployment. Inflation, in conjunction
with tax rules and accounting practices de-
signed for a stable price regime, has meant
very high marginal taxes on returns to
capital. In the judgement of some public
finance experts, it has also meant a differen-
tial burden on business investment com-
pared with that on household borrowing,
spending, and investing.'6 If there are fears
of accelerated inflation in the future, they
carry the prospect of still higher taxes and
lower returns while the erratic nature of
rapid inflation makes the future more dif-
ficult to discern and increases the sense of
risk. And if the same fears give rise to a
vision of price controls, the risks of invest-
ment and innovation are compounded. In
any event, inflation compels- or threatens
to compel-governments to reduce capacity
utilization below its potential. Therefore
inflation acts to diminish one of the induce-
ments to invest, as the 1980 business con-
traction following on financial disorder il-
lustrates. We should remember, moreover,
that there is an element of vicious circularity
in this aspect of our present conjecture. In-
flation has deleterious effects on productiv-
ity growth-and unexpected declines in
productivity growth exacerbate inflation.
This range of considerations leads some
students to the view that the pursuit of
alternative welfare goals accounts for a very
considerable part of the retardation. Fellner,
whom I mentioned before, suggests that "the
causes of at least 1 percentage point annual
slackening of the trend in output per
worker's hour can be found among the 'sus-
pects"' (p. 10). That loss is equal to one-half
the observed difference between the private-
sector productivity growth since 1973 and
that during the quarter century between 1948
and 1973.
Such numbers and the argument that leads
to them should be understood to be no more
than what they are-a prima facie indica-
tion that something very substantial may be
involved in the choices we make between
productivity growth and alternative welfare
goals. I would not mention them if I did not
fear that there is much to the problem, if
not as a cause of the recent abrupt retarda-
tion, then as a longer-term secular con-
straint. Yet, at the present time the argu-
ment is only speculative, and the estimated
loss still more so. The theoretical and
quantitative issues are unsettled and deserve
our most urgent attention.'7

the only statistically significant coefficient
is for question 10 for health economists.
Other things being equal, those who
agree with the induced-demand hypothesis are
more supportive of national health insurance
than those who disagree, but the effect on the
index (0.239) is less than changing one of the
four answers from disagree to agree. The actuarial
model regressions result in a few additional
significant coefficients but, in general,
the respondents' replies to the explicit positive
questions do not explain their position with respect
to such major policy issues as national
health insurance or insurance company underwriting
changes. It seems unlikely, then, that
their position on these policy issues can be explained
by differences in the embedded positive
questions.
Although I believe that differences in values
lie at the heart of the disagreement about
policy-value questions, I recognize that there
is scope for work on the embedded positive
questions and this work could contribute to a
narrowing of policy differences. One indication
of where research is needed is the percent
of health economists answering "no opinion"
on the individual policy-value questions. This
option was chosen most frequently (35 percent
of the time) for question 11 concerning the
optimality of expenditures on medical R&D.39
Given the importance of technologic change
in medicine both from the point of view of
health outcomes and of expenditures, this is
clearly a high-priority area for research. Two
other questions elicited a "no opinion" response
from one fifth of the health economists.
They are question 1 concerning the subsidies
for health insurance by size of firm (a key part
of the Clinton plan) and question 20 (about
differential premiums for persons born with
genetic defects). In the latter case the high percentage
responding "no opinion" may reflect
uncertainty regarding the magnitudes of the
efficiency and distributional implications of

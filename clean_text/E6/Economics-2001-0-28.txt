hours combined with slowing ALP growth during
1990-1995 to produce a further slide in the
growth of output. In previous cyclical recoveries
during the postwar period, output growth accelerated
during the recovery, powered by more rapid
growth of hours and ALP.
Accelerating output growth during 1995-
1999 reflects growth in labor hours and ALP
almost equally.38 Comparing 1990-1995 to
1995-1999, the rate of output growth jumped
by 1.72 percent-due to an increase in hours
worked of 0.81 percent and another increase in
ALP growth of 0.92 percent. Figure 12 shows
the acceleration in ALP growth is due to capital
deepening as well as faster TFP growth. Capital
deepening contributed 0.60 percentage points,
offsetting a negative contribution of labor quality
of 0.20 percent. The acceleration in TFP
added 0.51 percentage points.
H. Research Opportunities
The use of computers, software, and communications
equipment must be carefully distinguished
from the production of IT.39 Massive
increases in computing power, like those experienced
by the U.S. economy, have two effects
on growth. First, as IT producers become more
efficient, more IT equipment and software is
produced from the same inputs. This raises productivity
in IT-producing industries and contributes
to TFP growth for the economy as a
whole. Labor productivity also grows at both
industry and aggregate levels.
Second, investment in information technology
leads to growth of productive capacity in
IT-using industries. Since labor is working with
more and better equipment, this increases ALP
through capital deepening. If the contributions
to aggregate output are captured by capital
deepening, aggregate TFP growth is unaffected.
40 Increasing deployment of IT affects
TFP growth only if there are spillovers from
IT-producing industries to IT-using industries.
Top priority must be given to identifying the
impact of investment in IT at the industry level.
Stiroh (1998) has shown that this is concen-
38 Stiroh (2000) shows that ALP growth is concentrated
in IT-producing and IT-using industries.

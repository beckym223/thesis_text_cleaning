quantity of labor input account for the hetero-
geneity of the workforce across sex, employ-
ment class, age, and education levels. This
follows the approach of Jorgenson et al. (1987).
The estimates have been revised and updated by
Mun S. Ho and Jorgenson (2000).28
The distinction between labor input and labor
hours is analogous to the distinction between
capital services and capital stock. The growth in
labor quality is the difference between the
growth in labor input and hours worked. Labor
quality reflects the substitution of workers with
high marginal products for those with low mar-
ginal products. Table 5 presents estimates of
labor input, hours worked, and labor quality.
The value of labor expenditures in Table 5 is
$5.8 trillions in 1999, 59.3 percent of the value
of output. This share accurately reflects the con-
cept of gross domestic income, including impu-
tations for the value of capital services in
household and government sectors. As shown in
Table 2, the growth rate of labor input acceler-
ated to 2.18 percent for 1995-1999 from 1.70
percent for 1990-1995. This is primarily due to
the growth of hours worked, which rose from
1.17 percent for 1990-1995 to 1.98 percent for
1995-1999, as labor-force participation in-
creased and unemployment rates plummeted.
The growth of labor quality has declined con-
siderably in the late 1990's, dropping from 0.53
percent for 1990-1995 to 0.20 percent for
1995-1999. This slowdown captures well-
known demographic trends in the composition
of the workforce, as well as exhaustion of the
pool of available workers. Growth in hours
worked does not capture these changes in labor-
quality growth and is a seriously misleading
measure of labor input.
III. The American Growth Resurgence
The American economy has undergone a re-
markable resurgence since the mid-1990's with
accelerating growth in output, labor productiv-
ity, and total factor productivity. The purpose of
this section is to quantify the sources of growth
for 1948-1999 and various subperiods. An

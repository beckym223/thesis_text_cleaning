response to incentives that cannot be overlooked
in policy formulation, combined with the evi-
dence on the erratic and arbitrary nature of in-
centives provided by trade regimes, forced a
reexamination of the premises on which import-
substitution policies were based.
Yet another contribution of empirical re-
search was to focus upon the actual workings
of policy implementation. In early policy pre-
scriptions, there had been something of a naive
tendency to assume that enunciating a desired
outcome was itself sufficient to achieve it.
This naivete was dispelled, as the theories re-
garding bureaucratic behavior, rent-seeking,
smuggling, and overinvoicing and underin-
voicing all enabled observers to examine more
critically the ways in which alternative policy
prescriptions might have side effects that had
earlier been unanticipated.
B. Refinement and More Appropriate
Interpretation of Theory
As already seen, some of the intellectual un-
derpinning of import-substitution policies was
provided by inappropriate interpretation of
theory, or the failure of theory to take into ac-
count key institutional or behavioral variables.
Analytical developments focussing on condi-
tions under which these interpretations were
valid, or examining the ways in which results
had to be modified to take into account these
institutional and behaviorial aspects, were
clearly important in improving understanding.
The entire literature on optimal interven-
tions in the presence of domestic distortions is
one important example of a demonstration that
earlier interpretations of theory had failed to
examine the relevant alternatives. It was in-
valuable in demonstrating clearly that in most
circumstances, the presence of a distortion
warranted a first-best policy intervention other
than a tariff.43 For example, in the case of
Hagen's (1958) employment-generating case
for protection, the optimal intervention litera-
ture demonstrated clearly that a first-best in-
tervention would be in the labor market, and
that a tariff or quota could not achieve a first-
best outcome.
Similarly, developments showing that the
comparative advantage results were not the
simple "specialize forever in primary prod-
ucts" precept proved significant in enabling
policy makers to contemplate alteration in
trade strategy. Baldwin's (1969) critical ex-
amination of the infant industry argument pro-
vides yet another example of an analytical
contribution that was important in making
those concerned with policy consider carefully
the effectiveness of the policies they had
adopted in achieving their desired goals.
Finally, there was theory that was developed
in response to the functioning of import-
substitution regimes. Here again, the theory of
rent-seeking, as it pointed to the ways in which
bureaucrats and others made protection very
costly, was important. Further, when it was
recognized that bureaucrats, businessmen, and
others attempted to capture or thwart policy
initiatives not in their self-interest and that
they acquired an interest in maintaining the
system, once established, and that resources
were expended in operating the system, it had
to be recognized that changing the system
would be politically difficult.
Development of a better understanding of
the incentives for underinvoicing and overin-
voicing of exports and imports and for smug-
gling under exchange-control regimes worked
in the same direction: not only could these ac-
tivities prove costly to the exchequer and in
terms of resource drains, but the very recog-
nition of their presence served to remind
policy makers of the limitations of their
instruments.
Finally, good analyses demonstrating how
individual import controls actually worked
contributed to understanding and made em-
pirical work more effective. The further
refinement of theory showing tariff-quota
equivalence has already been mentioned.
Rent-seeking again comes to mind. But, in
addition, individual mechanisms for encour-
aging import substitution each had their
own, often idiosyncratic, incentive effects. A
good example is Gene Grossman's (1981)
classic analysis of domestic content regula-
tions and their effects.

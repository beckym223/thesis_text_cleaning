other people's smoke, then there would be
a case for considering that the game-form
be so modified that smoking is simply
banned in those gatherings. Whether or not
to make this move must depend crucially on
consequential analysis. The object, in this
case, is the prevention of the state of affairs
in which nonsmokers have to inhale unwill-
ingly other people's smoke: a situation they
resent and which-it is assumed-they
have a right to avoid. We proceed from
there, through consequential analysis (in an
"inverse" form: from consequences to
antecedents), to the particular game-form
formulation that would not achieve an
acceptable result. The fact that the arti-
culation of the game-form would be
consequence-independent and preference-
independent is not a terribly profound as-
sertion and is quite consistent with the fun-
damental relevance of consequences and
preferences.
The contrast between game-form formu-
lations and social-choice conceptions of
rights is, thus, less deep than it might first
appear (see Sen, 1992b).42 As in other fields
considered earlier (Section VI), in this area
too, the need to combine procedural con-
cerns with those of actual events and out-
comes is quite strong.
VIII. Values and Individual Choices
I have so far postponed discussing indi-
vidual behavior and rationality, though the
issue has indirectly figured in the preceding
discussions (for example, in dealing with
norms for social choice, individual interest
in social welfare judgments, and determina-
tion of voting behavior). The public choice
tradition has tended to rely a good deal on
the presumption that people behave in a
rather narrowly self-centered way-as homo
economicus in particular, even though
Buchanan (1986 p. 26) himself notes some
"tension" on this issue (see also Geoffrey
Brennan and Loren Lomarsky, 1993). Public
servants inter alia are to be seen as working
for their own well-being and success.
Adam Smith is sometimes described as
the original proponent of the ubiquity and
ethical adequacy of "the economic man,"
but that would be fairly sloppy history. In
fact, Smith (1776, 1790) had examined the
distinct disciplines of "self-love," "pru-
dence," "sympathy," "generosity," and
"public spirit," among others, and had dis-
cussed not only their intrinsic importance,
but also their instrumental roles in the suc-
cess of a society, and also their practical
influence on actual behavior. The demands
of rationality need not be geared entirely to
the use of only one of these motivations
(such as self-love), and there is plenty of
empirical evidence to indicate that the pre-
sumption of uncompromising pursuit of nar-
rowly defined self-interest is as mistaken
today as it was in Smith's time.43 Just as it is
necessary to avoid the high-minded senti-
mentalism of assuming that all human be-
ings (and public servants, in particular) try
constantly to promote some selfless "social
good," it is also important to escape what
may be called the "low-minded sentimental-
ism" of assuming that everyone is constantly
motivated entirely by personal self-
interest.44

pervasiveness of negative as well as positive
TFP performance among the components of
almost any aggregate. By learning more about
this aspect of the aggregate picture, we may
stumble upon ways to "accentuate the positive
and eliminate the negative" parts of the TFP
story. But that is too quixotic a goal to take as
the point of focus right now. To me, the present
task is simply to get hold of the huge mass
of information that is available at the firm
level and squeeze it hard enough to wring out
as much understanding and as much insight as
we can.
IV. Some Observations on Methods
and Research
What I am about to say in this section is not
meant to consist of direct implications of what
has gone before. Instead, I think of the earlier
parts of this paper as building a case for a certain
vision of the economy, and of how the
forces of growth work within it. This vision in
turn leads one to think in different ways not
only about the growth process itself but about
how we, as economists, might best advance
our study and understanding of it, and how
policies might be molded so as better to promote
it.
(a) It is always wise to study the components
of growth separately. The rate of investment,
the rate of return on capital, the rate
of growth of the labor force in numbers or in
hours worked, the contribution of human capital
or of the increment in average quality of
labor, and the residual representing real cost
reduction-all these are sufficiently different,
and potentially sufficiently disjoint from each
other, to merit their being treated separately. I
would give special emphasis to the following
three points.
(i) The worthwhileness of measuring the
rate of return and emphasizing its role in
the growth process.
(ii) The importance of focusing on investment
rather than saving in studying the

improved rapidly. Hong Kong and Singapore
also became part of the East Asian "miracle"
through policies designed to encourage ex-
porting. Growth rates exceeded those previ-
ously thought to represent an upper bound on
attainable performance.32
It was not until the 1980's, however, that
the importance of the differences became
unarguable. After the second oil price increase
of 1979, the worldwide recession of 1980-
1982, and the accompanying "debt crisis,"
the East Asian net importing countries (NICs)
rapidly resumed growth, whereas other heav-
ily indebted countries were unable to service
their debts and were hard hit by events in the
international economy. Research undertaken
in attempting to understand the impact of the
debt crisis on the developing countries made
it abundantly evident that the debt-GDP ratios
were not significantly different between the
two groups of countries. What was signifi-
cantly different was the debt-export ratios, as
the East Asian countries were able to maintain
debt servicing and resume growth because of
the greater flexibility of their economies.33 It
also emerged that, even prior to the debt crisis,
the rates of growth of inner-oriented devel-
oping countries had not increased despite sub-
stantial increases in their savings rates.:
This is not the place to enter into the debate
as to the factors contributing to the success of
the East Asian "tigers." For, while there is
debate about whether government intervention
in "picking the winners" was a key compo-
nent of the growth strategy, 35 all recognize that
the reversal from an import-substitution strat-
egy, the opening up of the economy, and the
relative uniformity of incentives across the
board were necessary, if not sufficient, for suc-
cess. Indeed, there is an irony in the fact that
the East Asian experience has stimulated some
to attempt to identify the "dynamic" factors
in exporting that are absent from production
for the domestic market. Thus, we have a com-
plete turnaround: in the 1950's and 1960's, the
neoclassical argument for an open trade re-
gime was rejected on the grounds that it was
"static" and ignored "dynamic considera-
tions"; in the 1990's, there appears to be wide-
spread agreement that the benefits of an open
trade regime are largely "dynamic" in nature,
and go well beyond the gains from trade under
"static" models of an open economy. Just as
was the case with the infant industry argument,
however, there is a question as to how to iden-
tify and measure these "dynamic" gains.
II. How Did Economists and Researchers
Go Wrong?
The "Washington consensus" is very dif-
ferent from the policy consensus that led to the
adoption of import-substitution policies in the
1950's and 1960's. While there will no doubt
be refinements in that consensus with further
experience and research, it is highly unlikely
that the ideas of the 1950's and 1960's will be
revived.
One can raise three questions about the
change in viewpoints. First, how could it be
that the economics profession, whose consen-
sus on the principle of comparative advantage
was at least as great as that on any other policy
issue, endorsed a highly protectionist policy
stance?36 Second, what factors contributed to

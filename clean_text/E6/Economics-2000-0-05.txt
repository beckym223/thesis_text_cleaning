daily caloric supplies at the beginning of the
eighteenth century of 2,095 for Great Britain
and 1,657 for France (Fogel, 1996 p. 10). Life
expectancy for England in 1725 is estimated to
be 32 years and in France in 1750, 26 years.
Over the next century per capita calories increased
by approximately 10 percent-to 2,237
in Great Britain and to 1,846 in France and by
1800 life expectancy in England was 36 years
and in France 32 years (Fogel, 1996 p. 2).
Obviously other factors had a role in the increase
in life expectancy, but it is unlikely that
these increases and those that followed would
have occurred in the absence of improved nutritional
intake.
A life expectancy of between 25 and 30 years
was probably the fate of most of humanity
throughout recorded history until about 1650
(Bogue, 1969 p. 566). It was not until the seventeenth
century that there is evidence that life
expectancy increased significantly beyond what
it was in Roman or earlier times. As noted,
England and France, two of the wealthiest nations
of the world, had life expectancies at the
beginning of the eighteenth century that were
not much above what had prevailed throughout
human history.
It is probable that the per capita calorie supplies
for the world prior to the seventeenth
century were in the range found in England and
France at the beginning of the eighteenth century-
perhaps from 1,650 to less than 2,000.
These are in the range of calorie intakes in many
developing countries in 1934-1938, the earliest
date for which we have estimates for several
countries. Calorie intakes in India, the Philippines,
Peru, Colombia, and Mexico were in the
range of 1,800 to 2,000 calories (M. K. Bennett,
1976 p. 199). By 1934-1938 these countries
had significant population growth rates and at
earlier times consumption was probably rather
less.
Important evidence that the productivity of
agricultural resources in Europe remained relatively
constant and low was that in Europe,
excluding Russia, there was almost no change
in the percentage of the total urban population
between 1300 and 1800. Bairoch (1988 pp. 177,
216) estimates that in 1300 the urban population
of Europe was 10.4 percent of the total; five
centuries later in 1800 it was only 12.1 percent
and most of this increase occurred in England in
the eighteenth century. The nineteenth century
saw a major increase in urbanization; by the end
of the nineteenth century the urban population
was 37.9 percent of Europe's population, Russia
excluded. The urban population increased
almost five times in the nineteenth century after
little more than doubling in the previous five
centuries (Bairoch, 1988 pp. 177, 216). The
development of cities as a significant share of
the total population became possible only after
farmers increased production relative to their
own consumption.
Further evidence that per capita output of
agriculture increased very little throughout history
was the slow growth of world population
until nearly the beginning of the nineteenth century.
During the first millennium of the current
era, the annual rate of growth was 0.04 percent,
a doubling time of 1700 years. In the 700 years
ending in 1700, the rate of population growth
was 0.12 percent, a doubling time of about 580
years. The rate of population growth did increase
in the eighteenth century-to 0.41 percent
annually. But even at that rate it would take
179 years to double.
Europe's population during the eighteenth
century increased from 102 million to 154 million
and this increase was made possible by a
significant increase in food production occurred.
However, except in England, there was
no increase in urbanization so it is reasonable to
infer that in the rest of Europe the growth of
food production increased at approximately the
same rate as population during the eighteenth
century.
I[I. Agriculture and the Industrial Revolution
What was agriculture's contribution to the
Industrial Revolution? The Industrial Revolution
is generally considered to have started
3 England was the exception; it had a significant increase
in urbanization during the eighteenth century. Bairoch
(1988 p. 215) estimates that the percentage of the population
that was urban in 1700 was 13-16, in 1750, 17-19, and in
1800, 22-24. For Europe, excluding England, there was no
increase in urbanization as a percentage of the total population
in the eighteenth century. England was also an imnportant
exception because it had a significant growth rate of
population in the last half of the eighteenth century of 0.82
percent annually compared to 0.5 percent for Europe (excluding
Russia).

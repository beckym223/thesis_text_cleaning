The title of my address implicitly assumes
that economics is itself one of the sciences.
I believe that to be so, and intend as I go on
to indicate more fully in what sense I hold
that view. However, my principal aim in
choosing my topic is not that of claiming
any particular status for economic analysis.
Rather, I want to share with you some ob-
servations I have made over the last six
years as a result of involvement in various
interdisciplinary studies, through reading
the reports of other such studies, or dis-
cussing them with colleagues in various
fields of science.
With increasing frequency natural and
social scientists are indeed finding them-
selves thrown together in the study of new
problems that are of great practical im-
portance for society, and essentially inter-
disciplinary in character. Prominent among
these are problems of environmental policy,
such as the protection of air and water
quality. Another class of problems concerns
a desirable long-range mix of technologies
of energy supply, conversion and use. These
two classes of problems overlap, for in-
stance, with respect to the disposal of nu-
clear wastes, heat rejection to the environ-
ment, and in the case of fossil fuels the
as yet poorly understood global and re-
gional effects of sustained large releases of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Assembled in pursuit of such studies, our
interdisciplinary group soon finds that its
diverse participants ask different questions;
use different concepts; use different terms
for the same concept and the same term
with different meanings; explicitly or im-
plicitly make different assumptions; and
perceive different opportunities for em-
pirical verification which may lead them
to apply different methods to that end. The
result can be politely concealed bewilder-
ment, possibly a suppressed surge of "we-
and-they" feeling, in the worst case a grow-
ing mistrust that only time and sustained
interaction can overcome.
I shall try to illustrate the difficulties of
such interaction by a few examples from re-
cent studies involving, besides economics,
mostly the natural sciences and engineering.
Limitations of experience, background, and
time have compelled me to omit examples
involving a strong participation from the
other social sciences. Had my guide, men-
tor, and dear friend Jacob Marschak lived
to give this address, and had he chosen a
similar topic, the social sciences would have
received an emphasis reflecting their impor-
tance to the problems of contemporary so-
ciety. The writings Marschak left us, and
the program and the Proceedings of last
year's meeting of the American Economic
Association, stand together as a monu-
ment to his awareness and vision of the
actual and potential contributions of the
social and behavioral sciences.
To prepare for the task I have set myself,
I have requested and obtained interviews
with a somewhat casually selected sample
of natural scientists and engineers, and with
a few colleagues in economics. Their re-
sponses have been drawn on in the prepara-
tion of this address, without attribution by
name. I here express my, and indeed our,
indebtedness for the help we have been
given. Later on, I will cite some statements
verbatim.

response to growing "foreign exchange shortage,
" in reaction to the "unfairness" of the
undifferentiated controls, and in response to
evasion of the regimes."9 Periodic balance of
payments crises arose in reaction to overvaluation
of the real exchange rate, increased indebtedness,
and the failure of export earnings
to grow.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) "stabilization"
programs were undertaken, under
which import regimes were simplified and rationalized
(as import licensing was, in those
years, not abolished). The nominal exchange
rate was normally altered (but usually to a
new fixed exchange rate in the face of continuing
inflation).20 Even in IMF programs,
however, it was seldom intended that the
underlying trade policies related to import
substitution be changed: the intent, rather,
was to rationalize the trade regime and find
ways to induce more foreign exchange earnings
to finance the capital goods that would
be imported to undertake additional importsubstitution
investments. Growth proceeded
in "stop-go" fashion, as periods of foreign
exchange crisis were followed by tight(er)
monetary and fiscal policies, a consequent reduction
in excess demand for imports, and an
increase in foreign exchange earnings. When
the trade regime was again relaxed, growth
resumed and the demand for imports again
mushroomed until the next crisis.21
E. Research Directions and Contributions
Most research in the 1950's and 1960's was
based on the premises outlined above, and supported
the basic thrusts of policy. It needs only
brief mention here. Some focussed on the possible
existence of externalities and the need for
"balanced growth," as it was assumed that
expansion of any one industry alone would not
be feasible because of the limited size of the
market.22 This prescription, of course, was
based on the premise that development of
manufactured exports was not feasible. Another
line of supportive research focussed on
planning models, concentrating in large part
on interindustry flows and linkages.23 Empirical
research on pattems of development began,
focussing on the structure of economies
and their growth performance. For more than
a decade, the growing disparity between theory
and practice was all but ignored.
There was also research providing a rationale
for protection of new industries and import
substitution. These results demonstrated that
domestic distortions could warrant trade intervention
24 in a number of situations. Everett E.
Hagen (1958), in perhaps the best known of
these, set up a model assuming that urban
wages exceeded rural wages exogenously, and
demonstrated that a tariff could improve welfare
by inducing resources into the (artificially)
higher-cost urban industries.
Work also continued on structuralist models,
as a number of authors found reasons
why developing countries' economic structures
were "different" and why, therefore, the
usual economic analysis would not apply.25
Chenery and Michael Bruno (1962), Chenery
and Alan Strout (1966), and Chenery and
many other coauthors developed the "twogap"
model, using the stylized fact that
foreign exchange was "scarce" in developing
countries. In this model, export earnings
were exogenously given and growing more
slowly than the demand for foreign exchange.

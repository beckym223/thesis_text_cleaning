economic theorist seldom asks. An excep-
tion should be made for the relevant litera-
ture in the field of labor economics. Simi-
larly, some exception should be made for
the recent literature on human capital, but
at best it is only a partial exception.5 The
mathematically inclined general theorist
continues to show little interest in the de-
terminants of the personal distribution of
income and wealth.6 It has been said by
George Stigler that: "The problem of per-
sonal income distribution will eventually
receive much theoretical attention, since
it is a problem of all economies and all
times" (p. 22). (Compare Becker, p. 135.)
But if the problem is so important, why
only "eventually"? It is not surprising
that many younger economists are seeking
a radical alternative for the neoclassical
framework, more or less along Marxian
lines. And it is also this concern with the
unequal personal distribution of oppor-
tunity and income which has led to the
development of models of a dual labor mar-
ket. These models, with their emphasis on
institutional barriers to labor mobility,
offer some valuable insights into the opera-
tion of contemporary labor markets, and
they also raise important questions about
some of the assumptions implicit in neo-
classical theory.7
From the point of view of human wel-
fare-a concept that will not go away no
matter how uncomfortable it makes the
economic theorist-can we ignore the per-
sonal distribution of income? Which is
more relevant: a rigorous demonstration as
to how resources can be most efficiently
allocated under ideal conditions that have
never existed, or a much cruder exploration
of how wealth and income came to be dis-
tributed as they in fact are and what might
be done to affect the distribution of income
in one way or another? As Alice Rivlin put
it in her Ely lecture last year (p. 2), econo-
mists "worth their pay" ought to be able
to explain the shape of the income distribu-
tion and why it is changing or not chang-
ing. By this criterion very few of us are
worth our pay.8 To go further, why do
we have so little to say about the inter-
generational movement among occupa-
tional and income classes, about the deter-
minants of the distribution of income
relative to those affecting the distribution
of wealth, and about the ethnic, social, po-
litical, and regional factors affecting the
distribution of both wealth and income?
Am I suggesting that economic theory
become much more normative than it now
is? Of course I am not. "Relevant" and
"normative" are not synonyms, and what
I am alleging here is that neoclassical eco-
nomics has failed to be relevant in its
refusal to deal with the personal distribu-
tion of income and wealth. This refusal
stems, I presume, fron the fact that, with
the analytical tools at hand, the problem
has seemed too difficult.
I should add in this connection that neo-
classical economics has always had a nor-
mative slant. As others have suggested,

would be more severe in the absence of a pro-
gram. These different shortcomings in prepara-
tion for retirement relate to different issues-
inadequate overall provision for retirement
relates to having a mandatory program, inade-
quate annuitization relates to providing benefits
in annuitized form, inadequate protection of
family members relates to providing benefits for
surviving spouses and young children. I start
with the annuitization issue, since there is little
overt move to end the mandatory nature of
Social Security as a whole. But there are calls
for decreasing the role of annuities in Social
Security.
But first a word on the Arrow-Debreu frame-
work. I have referred to it above as a way to
describe the properties of a Pareto-optimal al-
location. I think that when economists quickly
consider economic issues outside their own sub-
disciplines, they frequently think implicitly in
terms of the Arrow-Debreu model with its con-
nection to first-best outcomes (also incorporat-
ing overlapping generations for some issues). In
contrast, economists thinking about issues in
their subdisciplines often share a framework
that is more complex and are more inclined to
do second-best analyses, which are more di-
rectly policy-relevant. As in other subdisci-
plines, analysts of Social Security are well
aware of the issues I have identified, although
the issues are not present in all analyses by any
means. The Arrow-Debreu model tends to start
our thinking in terms of the standard, fully
rational model of individual decision making
and in terms of a complete set of markets. That
is a reasonable place to start as long as it is not
also the end of modeling and thinking. For
example, simulations of Social Security reforms
that assume an overlapping generations model
with fully rational lifetime utility maximization
should not be taken as the whole story for Social
Security policy-making. It is inadequate and
potentially misleading to study the effects of
Social Security in models in which there is no
particular reason for Social Security to exist in
the first place. This would be akin to treating
Pigouvian taxation to correct externalities as
distortive by ignoring the externalities.
Interest in the description of behavior that
deviates from that in the Arrow-Debreu model
has grown enormously lately. Long before be-
havioral economics became a hot topic, public
policies reflected recognition that the model of  homo economicus, while very useful, is not a
fully adequate basis for the design of all poli-
cies. For example, federal legislation introduced
a "cooling-off' period during which contracts
with door-to-door salespeople could be can-
celled without penalty precisely because of de-
viations from homo economicus. And social
security discussions have long recognized inad-
equate savings for retirement by many workers
and inadequate annuitization by most. In addi-
tion, social security systems have been con-
cerned about protection of the family and not
just the worker.9 Also possibly relevant, but not
much studied, is whether significant numbers of
workers retire too soon for their own good.
These issues of poor choices in the presence of
available opportunities are in addition to in-
surance market limitations that come from
market incompleteness and from asymmetric  information.
Inadequate attention to the future in general
and its stochastic structure in particular implies
some form of time inconsistency. Normative
criteria for evaluating institutions become more
complicated without time consistency through-
out the population. Insofar as individuals are not
time-consistent, it seems essential to do norma-
tive evaluations in terms of shorter periods (e.g.,
years) as well as in terms of lifetimes. We care
about actual consumption levels as well as the
levels of lifetime resources.
This requires more than just a positive theory
of how people determine consumption but also
normative criteria for evaluating consumption
at different times. The vocabulary of someone
being different selves at different times is sug-
gestive, although I am concerned that taking it
too literally, failing to recognize the tight links
between the different selves who are the same
person at somewhat different ages, is failing to
address adequately the underlying issues.'? And

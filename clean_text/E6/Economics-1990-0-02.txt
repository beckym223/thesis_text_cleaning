an agenda for further reform in the context
of the current fiscal crisis. I believe that,
when the nation gets around to eliminating
or substantially reducing the federal deficit,
the income tax should play an important
role.4

Distribution of Income and Tax Burdens
It is well known that, after several decades
of relative stability, the U.S. pre-tax income
distribution has become much more unequal
in the last ten years. Official statistics understate
the increasing inequality. At the same
time, the tax system as a whole-and the
income tax in particular-has become less
equalizing, so that the trend toward inequality
is even more pronounced after tax than
before tax.

Distribution of Income. The longest continuous
and comparable income distribution
series available to us comes from the annual
Current Population Survey (CPS) of the
Census Bureau. The figures show that the
share of total income received by the highest
fifth of the nation's families fell from 1948 to
1952, remained unchanged between 1952 and
1981, and then rose from 1981 to 1988. By
1988, the share of the top fifth was the
highest ever recorded. The figures for the top
5 percent are similar, except that their share
in 1987 had not quite recovered to the 1952
high (Table 1).

It is well known that very high incomes
are virtually unrepresented in the CPS distribution
and that official census statistics
greatly understate income inequality in any
year. What is not recognized is that the CPS
data greatly understate the increase in inequality
that has occurred during the 1980s
because very high incomes have been increasing
much faster than the incomes in the
lower part of the distribution.5 This can be


seen by examining changes in the shares of
the top income recipients reported in the
annual Statistics of Income published by the
Internal Revenue Service (Table 2).6
Like the CPS data, the tax data show that
the very rich in the United States-defined
as either the top 1 percent or the top 5
percent of the income distribution-enjoyed
about the same income increases as the average
income recipient in the 1950s, 1960s, and
1970s, but their share of total income has
been rising in the 1980s. From 1952 to 1981,
the share of the top 1 percent of the tax
units remained in a very narrow range-between
8 and 9 percent of the total income
reported on tax returns. Since 1981, their
share has skyrocketed to 14.7 percent in
1986. The same trends are shown by the top
2, 5, 10, and 15 percent of the tax units.
Much of the increase in the share of the
top tax units reflects the large increase in
realized capital gains that accompanied the
bull market of the 1980s. But salaries and
other incomes of the top units have also
been increasing faster than average.7 In fact,

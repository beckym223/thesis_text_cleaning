by political or quasipolitical compromise, it
is in the common interest of the community
to avoid waste. The content of the
political compromise plays a significant
role in shaping the waste-avoidance problem
with which the private as well as the
public sector is faced. Given some specific
compromise on the priority-rankings, the
avoidance of waste requires the solution of
technical problems that are far from trivial
from a professional point of view. Yet any
substantive suggestion on how to satisfy
the marginal criteria of socially desirable
allocation for the progress-inputs inevitably
implies distinctly personal preferences
which need to be reconciled with the
preferences of others. Preferences of this
sort are essentially preferences of an individual
for one variety of political compromise
("as if" utility function) rather
than another."6
This very high degree of subjectivity
does not attach to all substantive propossitions
that may be developed on the yield
of the progress-effort. It is possible to suggest
substantive propositions not only
about the average social rate of return
from each period's progress-activities but
also about tlle algebraic sign of the difference
between the average and the marginal
social rate to which a much lesser
degree of subjectivity attaches. Event if an
individual were in a position to exert decisive
influence on the composition of the
progress-generating inputs-or if for any
reason he ideiitified himself fully with politically
determined priority-rankings-he
would still be apt to find a considerable
gap between the average and the marginal
social rates from the progress-activities of
a period, provided that these activities are
pursued on a significant scale. The gap
between average and marginal rates develops
because high talent shades over
into lesser talent, and because the solution
of problems is an inherently sequential pro.
cess. This is ain essential property-we
may perhaps say a Schumpeterian property
-of the progress-generating activities. By
way of "transitivity," the following propositions
follow from the average-marginal
gap in the progress activities:
a) Each person has reason to consider it
a necessary condition of his approval of a
set of allocative decisions that by his
standards the average social rate of return
from the progress-activities should exceed
the marginal social rate of return from
physical investment "at a given level of
technological knowledge";
b) the necessary condition requires also
that the average rate of progress-return
should exceed the marginal market rate
from the current flow of physical investment,
since we may assume that this
market rate is no higher than the marginal
social rate from physical investment;
c) finally, no undue stretching is involved
in extending this condition to the
requirement that the average rate of progress-
return should exceed the rate of return
on the capital stock-say, the algebraic
product of the share of capital in income
with the ratio of yearly output to
capital"7-since we may assume that normally
this rate is not very different from
the marginal market rate on physical investment.

It therefore seems reasonable to conclude
that from each individual's point of
view it is a necessary condition of good
allocation that by his standards the average
social rate of return from the progressgenerating
activities of the successive
periods should tend to exceed the profit
rate on physical capital, i.e., should exceed
the rate which in traditional theory is interpreted
as the net marginal productivity

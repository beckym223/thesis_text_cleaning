by political or quasipolitical compromise, it
is in the common interest of the commun-
ity to avoid waste. The content of the
political compromise plays a significant
role in shaping the waste-avoidance prob-
lem with which the private as well as the
public sector is faced. Given some specific
compromise on the priority-rankings, the
avoidance of waste requires the solution of
technical problems that are far from trivial
from a professional point of view. Yet any
substantive suggestion on how to satisfy
the marginal criteria of socially desirable
allocation for the progress-inputs inev-
itably implies distinctly personal prefer-
ences which need to be reconciled with the
preferences of others. Preferences of this
sort are essentially preferences of an in-
dividual for one variety of political com-
promise ("as if" utility function) rather
than another."6
This very high degree of subjectivity
does not attach to all substantive propos-
sitions that may be developed on the yield
of the progress-effort. It is possible to sug-
gest substantive propositions not only
about the average social rate of return
from each period's progress-activities but
also about tlle algebraic sign of the dif-
ference between the average and the mar-
ginal social rate to which a much lesser
degree of subjectivity attaches. Event if an
individual were in a position to exert de-
cisive influence on the composition of the
progress-generating inputs-or if for any
reason he ideiitified himself fully with po-
litically determined priority-rankings-he
would still be apt to find a considerable
gap between the average and the marginal
social rates from the progress-activities of
a period, provided that these activities are
pursued on a significant scale. The gap
between average and marginal rates de-
velops because high talent shades over
into lesser talent, and because the solution
of problems is an inherently sequential pro.
cess. This is ain essential property-we
may perhaps say a Schumpeterian property
-of the progress-generating activities. By
way of "transitivity," the following propo-
sitions follow from the average-marginal
gap in the progress activities:
a) Each person has reason to consider it
a necessary condition of his approval of a
set of allocative decisions that by his
standards the average social rate of return
from the progress-activities should exceed
the marginal social rate of return from
physical investment "at a given level of
technological knowledge";
b) the necessary condition requires also
that the average rate of progress-return
should exceed the marginal market rate
from the current flow of physical invest-
ment, since we may assume that this
market rate is no higher than the marginal
social rate from physical investment;
c) finally, no undue stretching is in-
volved in extending this condition to the
requirement that the average rate of prog-
ress-return should exceed the rate of re-
turn on the capital stock-say, the alge-
braic product of the share of capital in in-
come with the ratio of yearly output to
capital"7-since we may assume that nor-
mally this rate is not very different from
the marginal market rate on physical in-
vestment.
It therefore seems reasonable to con-
clude that from each individual's point of
view it is a necessary condition of good
allocation that by his standards the aver-
age social rate of return from the progress-
generating activities of the successive
periods should tend to exceed the profit
rate on physical capital, i.e., should exceed
the rate which in traditional theory is in-
terpreted as the net marginal productivity

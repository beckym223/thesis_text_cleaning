One could also see a continuous and worri-
some decline in the number of patents re-
ceived per corporate R&D dollar (see be-
low). But there were also many other events
clouding this picture, making one wonder
whether faltering R&D and scientific efforts
are really the culprits behind our current
woes.
A number of discordant facts are impor-
tant for an understanding of what hap-
pened. First, the productivity-growth de-
cline in many other countries was larger,
absolutely, than in the United States, and
there it was not associated with declines in
R&D investment.2 Second, as illustrated in
Figure 1, the sectors where the productivity
slowdown has persisted in the United States
are largely outside of manufacturing, com-
munications, and agriculture (see Gordon,
1987). Besides mining and public utilities,
which were affected more specifically by the
energy-price shocks, it has lingered particu-
larly in construction, finance, and other ser-
vices where output measurement is notori-
ously difficult. Third, the decline in patent
grants in the 1970's was just a bureaucratic
mirage, an example of fluctuations induced
by changes in the data-generating process (a
budgetary crisis in the Patent Office) rather
than a reflection of the underlying activity
itself.3 The number of patent applications
did not decline significantly during this pe-
riod, but also it did not grow. The latter
fact, coupled with a continuous upward
growth in the absolute level of company-
financed R&D, resulted in a persistent de-

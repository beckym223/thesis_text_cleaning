FIGURE 1. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER MAN-HOUR (THOUSANDS OF 1982
DOLLARS, UNITED STATES, 1948-1990)
Notes: Measurable sectors are agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation,
communications, and public utilities; unmeasurable sectors are construction, trade,
finance, other services, and government. Values for 1977-1987 are based on 1987
weights; values for 1948-1976 are based on 1982 weights (the series are linked at  1977).
One could also see a continuous and worrisome
decline in the number of patents received
per corporate R&D dollar (see below)
. But there were also many other events
clouding this picture, making one wonder
whether faltering R&D and scientific efforts
are really the culprits behind our current
woes.
A number of discordant facts are important
for an understanding of what happened.
First, the productivity-growth decline
in many other countries was larger,
absolutely, than in the United States, and
there it was not associated with declines in
R&D investment.2 Second, as illustrated in
Figure 1, the sectors where the productivity
slowdown has persisted in the United States
are largely outside of manufacturing, communications,
and agriculture (see Gordon,
1987). Besides mining and public utilities,
which were affected more specifically by the
energy-price shocks, it has lingered particularly
in construction, finance, and other services
where output measurement is notoriously
difficult. Third, the decline in patent
grants in the 1970's was just a bureaucratic
mirage, an example of fluctuations induced
by changes in the data-generating process (a
budgetary crisis in the Patent Office) rather
than a reflection of the underlying activity
itself.3 The number of patent applications
did not decline significantly during this period,
but also it did not grow. The latter
fact, coupled with a continuous upward
growth in the absolute level of companyfinanced
R&D, resulted in a persistent de-
2For example, the rate of growth in total factor
productivity declined between the 1960's and the 1970's
by 4.5 percent in Japan, 3.3 percent in France, and
"only" 2 percent in the United States (see Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development,  1993).

additional knowledge-distribution because
even insofar as the neoclassical approach
attributes a growth-component to mere
factor-substitution-i.e., insofar as physical
investment exceeds the equivalent of
mere "widening"-such investment presupposes
the invention of new equipment
of lesser labor-intensity.'9 Practically all
long-run increase of output per man-hour
(and even the prevention of some decrease
resulting from land-scarcity) requires at
least some amount of additional per capita
knowledge which may or may not express
itself in the production of new types of
equipment20; the reverse proposition that
making use of new ideas requires new capital
goods is hazy because new capital goods
result from new ideas applied to already
existing types of equipment. If one wanted
to follow through consistently the implications
of the conception that all long-run
increase in man-hour output reflects technological
progress, one would arrive at even
higher productivity-gains than those which
we shall assume (though at more costly
ones); the progress-generated productivity-
gains so defined would show a rising
tendency, as will ours; and these progressgains
too would point to high but somewhat
declining rates of social return, similar
to ours.2' We will not follow through all
the implications of this "inclusive" conception
of progress though one of its several
implications will be carried over into the
framework I am using because in mine, too,
economies of scale will become merged
with "progress." My main reason for not
following through all the implications of
the most inclusive conception is that some
possible ways of increasing man-hour
output require new ideas only in a very
modest sense of this term, i.e., require
merely somewhat trivial new ideas (resulting
in slow changes of the physical
composition of the capital stock). Thisis
what in my appraisal justifies the "neoclassical"
procedure of attributing part of
the increase in output per man-hour to
changes in input-proportions aside from
technological progress. But this way of
looking at the problem still leaves one with
a preference for principles that lead to
higher progress-estimates than do the principles
suggested in some other contributions
to growth theory.
My analysis will rely on the method of
the Residual as it is employed by John
Kendrick for measuring the proportionate
rate of increase of productivity. From this
productivity-increase I will derive the
magnitude I consider the benefit resulting
from the progress-generating costs.
As is well known, the method of the
Residual attributes to technological advance
that increase in output which is not
attributed to the increase in physical
inputs given their base-period productivities.
The measurement of productivity assumes
measurement of the price-corrected market

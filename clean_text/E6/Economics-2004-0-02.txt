I frequently find economists who express a
view of the system that is very far from mine.
For example, many young economists and eco-
nomics students say that they expect to get no
benefits at all from Social Security. This expec-
tation does not seem sensible to me. If there is
no legislation changing Social Security, trust
fund assets and payroll tax revenue (and reve-
nue from the taxation of benefits) are projected
to be sufficient to pay all the benefits scheduled
under current law until 2042 (Board of Trustees
of Social Security and Medicare, 2003). After
the trust fund assets are exhausted the payroll
tax revenue would continue to be available to
pay benefits, with the flow of revenues at that
time sufficient to pay roughly three-quarters of
the benefits scheduled in current law. The esti-
mate for the end of the 75-year projection pe-
riod shows enough revenue to pay roughly
two-thirds of scheduled benefits. With initial
benefits indexed to earnings, average real ben-
efits would be higher than today, although re-
placement rates would only be roughly 60
percent of current levels for the medium
worker. This projection is a far cry from no
benefits.
Moreover, I anticipate that Congress will act
before the trust fund is exhausted, both lowering

count the once and for all costs of movement.
These calculations are like those of
the planner, but witlh an important difference.
An individual does not initernalize
all the considerations the planner takes
into account. The external effects are the
familiar ones of congestion theory. A
worker decidling to join a queue or to stay
in one consi(lers the probabilities of getting
a job, but not the effects of his decision on
the probabilities that others face. He
lowers those probabilities for people in
the queue he joins and raises them for persons
waiting for the kind of job he vacates
or turns (lown. tI0oo many persons are
unemployed waiting for good jobs, while
less desirable ones go begging. However,
externial effects also occur in the
(lecisions of employers whether to fill a
vacancy with the applicant at hand or to
wait for someone more qualified. It is not
obvious, at least to me, whether the market
is biased toward excessive or inadlequate
search. But it is doubtful that it
produces the optimal amounit.
Empirically the proposition that in the
United States the zero-inflation rate of
unemployment reflects voluntary and efficienit
job-seeking activity strains credulity.
If there were a natural rate of unemployment
in the United States, what would it
be? It is hard to say because virtually all
econometric Phillips curves allow for a
whole menu of steady inflation rates. But
estimates constrained to produce a vertical
long-run Phillips curve suggest a natural
rate between 5 and 6 percent of the labor
force.3
So let us consider some of the features of
an overall unemployment rate of 5 to 6 percent.
First, about 40 percent of accessions
in manufacturing are rehires rather than
new hires. Temporarily laid off by their
employers, these workers had been awaiting
recall and were scarcely engaged in
voluntary search activity. Their unemployment
is as much a deadweight loss as
the disguised unemployment of redundant
workers oni payrolls. This number declines
to 25-30 percent when unemployment is
4 percent or below. Likewise, a 5-6 perceint
unemployment rate means that voluntary
quits amount only to about a third of
separations, layoffs to two-thir(-ds. The proportions
are rever-sed at low unemployment
rates.
Second, the unemployment statistic is
not an exhaustive count of those with time
and inceintive to search. An additional
3 percent of the labor force are involuntarily
confinedI to part-time work, atid another
3 4 of t percent are out of the labor
force because they "could not find job" or
"think no work available"---discouraged
by market con(litions rather than personal
incapacities.
Third, with unemployment of 5-6 percent
the number of reported vacancies is
less than 1/ 2 of 1 percent. Vacancies appear
to be understated relative to unemployment,
but they rise to l2 percent when
the unemployment rate is below 4 percent.
At 5-6 percent unemployment, the
economy is clearly capable of generating
many more jobs with marginal productivity
high enough so that people prefer
them to leisure. TI he capital stock is Ino
limitation, siince 5-6 percent unemployment
has beeni associated with more than
20 percent excess capacity. Mioreover,
when more jobs are createdI by expansion
of demand, with or without inflation, labor
force participation increases; this would
hardly occur if the aclditional jobs were low
in quality and productivity. As the parable
of the central employment plannier indicates,
there will be excessive waiting for
jobs if the roster of jobs an(d the meniu of
vacancies are suboptimal.
In summary, labor markets characterized
by 5-6 percent unemployment do
not display the symptoms one would ex-

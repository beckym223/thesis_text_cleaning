As the twentieth century ends, both the share
and the absolute amount of the world's re-
sources devoted to the development of new
knowledge are vastly greater than at the begin-
ning of the century. Equally important is that
the share of resources devoted to the wide dis-
tribution of that knowledge has also increased
greatly.
VII. Population Growth-Roles of Fertility
and Mortality
My third point is that population growth in
the developed countries in the nineteenth cen-
tury and in the developing countries in the twen-
tieth century was due almost entirely to
mortality declines and not to fertility increases.
In other words, the response of men and women
to improved circumstances-improved nutri-
tion and higher incomes-was not to increase
fertility significantly. For the nineteenth century
the picture is clear. For the three European
countries, both fertility and mortality declined.
In England and Sweden there was an increase in
fertility during the latter half of the eighteenth
century but the increase was small (less than 10
percent) and lasted less than 50 years before
declining throughout the nineteenth century.
The increases in fertility had little or no effect
on population growth in Europe, with a modest
positive effect in Sweden and England from
perhaps 1750 to 1800, but with declines
throughout the nineteenth century.
The total fertility rate (average number of
children per woman) for Sweden increased from
4.21 in 1750 to 4.68 in 1800 but then declined
continuously throughout the nineteenth century,
reaching a level of 1.90 in 1990 (Massimo Livi-
Bacci, 1992 p. 122). Life expectancy in the last
20 years of the eighteenth century was 34 years,
increasing to 39 years by 1835 and to 54 years
in the first decade of the twentieth century
(Nathan Keyfitz and Wilhelm Flieger, 1968 pp.
36-37).
Total fertility rates for England increased
from 5.28 in 1750 to 5.87 in 1775 and then
declined to 1.96 in 1900 (Livi-Bacci, 1989 p.
122). In the early period of the Industrial Rev-
olution there seems to have been a small posi-
tive response in fertility to the improved
circumstances that lasted less than half a cen-
tury and had only a modest effect on the rate of
population growth. In England life expectancy
was 32 years in the last fifth of the seventeenth
century and remained at that level in the years
before 1750. It increased to 36 years by the end
of the eighteenth century and to 41 years by the
middle of the nineteenth century (Wrigley and
Schofield, 1981 pp. 528-29) and continued to
increase thereafter. In France the fertility and
mortality trends are very clear-the total fertil-
ity rate was low in 1825 at 3.42 and fell con-
tinuously reaching 2.14 in 1900 (Livi-Bacci,
1992 p. 122). Life expectancy increased from
about 28 years in 1760 to 40 years in 1840 and
to 46 years at the end of the century (Wrigley,
1987 pp. 274).
The data on fertility and mortality available
for the developing countries since 1960 prove
that the source of the rapid population growth in
these countries was the decline in mortality
rather than an increase in fertility. In fact, both
mortality and fertility fell much more rapidly in
the developing countries in the twentieth cen-
tury than in the developed countries in the nine-
teenth century prior to 1875.7 Excluding China,
which has had coercive restraints on fertility,
the decline in fertility in the 31 lowest-income
countries from 1960 to 1995 was 38 percent
(United Nations Development Program
[UNDP], 1998). Over the same period of time,
life expectancy increased from 42 years to 59
years for the same countries. But the fertility
decline lagged behind the mortality decline by a
decade or more and high rates of population
growth occurred in the 1960's and the 1970's.
For example, between 1960 and 1978, in the 38

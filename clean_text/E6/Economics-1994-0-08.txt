fore I discuss it, I need to digress briefly
and remind you about the developments in
computer price measurement.
Quality change is the bane of price and
output measurement. Until 1986, computer
prices were treated as unchanged in the
national income accounts. It took 25 years
for the recommendations of the Stigler
committee (Griliches, 1961; National Bureau
of Economic Research, 1961) to have a
noticeable effect on official practice, but
when they did, they did it with a bang! In
1986 the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) introduced a new computer price
index, based on hedonic regression methods,
into the national accounts and revised
them back to 1972 (Rosanne Cole et al.,
1986).8 This index was falling by about 15
percent per year or more (as compared to
the assumed value of zero before), and that
had several major implications, including
the fact that it made the apparent recovery
in manufacturing productivity in the 1980's
much stronger, about one-third of the total
coming from the introduction of this price
index alone (Gordon, 1993b).
There was nothing wrong with the price
index itself. It was, indeed, a major advance,
and the BEA should be congratulated for
making it, but the way it was introduced
created some problems. First, it was a
unique adjustment. No other high-tech
product had received parallel treatment, and
thus it stuck out like a sore thumb. This had
the unfortunate consequence that the productivity
growth in the computer industry
itself was seriously overestimated, because
some of its major inputs, such as semiconductors,
were not similarly deflated. Second,
it was introduced into a framework with
fixed weights, wrecking havoc on it. Using
fixed 1982 weights and a sharply falling price
index implied the absence of a "real" computer
industry in the early 1970's and a very
rapid growth in its importance, leading to a
more than doubling of the share of machinery
in total manufacturing output by the

late 1980's. This last problem has largely
been solved recently with the introduction
of "benchmark-weighted" estimates of gross
domestic product (GDP) and the moving
away from fixed-weights national income accounting
(Allan Young, 1992). But the first
problem, the uniqueness of this adjustment
in the face of similar, though perhaps not as
extreme, problems elsewhere remains to
haunt us.
What I have done in Figure 3 (and in row
3b of Table 1) is to adjust the estimated
TFP growth in the computer industry downward
by deflating materials purchases in
this industry, which to a significant extent
consist of purchases of other computer components
and semiconductors, by the same
output price index. I have also substituted a
similar price index in the semiconductors
(electronic components) industry and also
adjusted the growth of TFP in the pharmaceuticals
industry upward to reflect the
exclusion of price declines due to the introduction
of generics in the current measurement
procedures. (I shall come back to
discuss this last adjustment later on.) So
adjusted, Figure 3 does not look all that

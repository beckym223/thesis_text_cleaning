The required simplifying assumptions
are reasonably well satisfied in the macro-
economic Cobb-Douglas framework. The
CES model also acquires the needed prop-
erties if we work into it a mechanism of
induced invention and of distributive-
shares equilibrium.8 This is explained in
Appendix A. In Sections III and IV we
shall return to the question how much
similarity of the real world with such
models is implied in my paper.
I should add that on both sides of my
benefit-cost ledger I will have to disregard
problems of considerable importance which
either cannot be articulated sufficiently
well, or, if capable of articulation, can
be appraised only in very vague terms. I
will not be able to consider the question
whether all-too-rapid change does not re-
duce our well-being "in a fundamental
sense," or, on the other hand, whether at a
stagnant or near-stagnant level of tech-
nology the institutions of Western nations
would be workable at all. Nor will I try to
explore the relationship of technological
progress to population growth and to its
specific consequences.
II. Two Versions of the Social Benefit-
Cost Ratio, and their Meaning
A substantial part of the progress-gen-
erating costs of each period is incurred by
decision makers subjected to the criterion
of private economic yield. The progress-
costs falling in this category consist mainly
of the costs of privately financed research
and development (R & D) and of the extra
costs of changing over to new industrial
processes. Though we are concerned here
with the problem of social yield, we should
obviously include these private yield-ori-
ented costs in the cost-base of our benefit-
cost ratio.
Another large part of the progress-gen-
erating expenses is incurred by agencies
not institutionally subjected to criteria of
economic yield. The government-financed
R & D9 and that financed by other non-
profit institutions belong here, and so does
almost all of the cost of increased per
capita education.10 This does not mean
that the nonprofit institutions incurring
these costs are under no political or quasi-
political" pressure to keep costs down per
unit of service; what it does mean is that
these costs create net income by definition,
i.e., that their net-income-creating prop-
erty does not depend on whether they
generate offsetting revenues. Nonprofit in-
stitutions, most prominently illustrated by
governments, but illustrated also by pri-
vate teaching organizations, can have def-
cits but these deficits are not usually
viewed as negative income such as would
cancel any part of the incomes created by
the institutions. In the language of na-
tional accounting, the services of these in-
stitutions are valued at cost, though, when
appraising the worth of the services, any
individual may find this valuation uncon-
vincing. In this regard such costs are
treated differently from those of firms,
e.g., differently from that R & D compo-
nent which is financed by industry.'2 The

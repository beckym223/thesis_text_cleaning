than a third of either the market or the household
labor once required (Fogel, 2000).
Table 4 shows how sharply the U.S. distribution
of consumption has changed over the
past 120 years. Food, clothing, and shelter,
which accounted for about three-quarters of
consumption in 1875, accounted for just 12
percent in 1995. Leisure, on the other hand,
has risen from 18 percent of consumption to
67 percent.6 As Table 4 shows, the long-term
income elasticities of the demand for food and
clothing are below 0.5 and the elasticity of the
demand for shelter is closer to, but still below,
1.0. On the other hand, the long-term income
elasticities for leisure, education, and for medical
services are over 1.O.7
Table 4 differs from current official tabulations
of household consumption in two principal
respects. Official tabulations, with minor
exceptions, are limited to the out-of-pocket expenditures
of households. Table 4, however,
adds expenditures for education and health
care consumed by households but paid by government,
employers, and other third parties.
My procedure does little to change the distribution
of consumption in 1875 but significantly
increases the education and health-care
shares of consumption in 1995.8
Table 4 also differs from official tabulations
by adding to the value of out-of-pocket expenditures
on leisure, the value of the time devoted
to leisure (volwork). That time is priced
at the average hourly rate of compensation of
labor. The procedure increases the share of leisure
in consumption in both 1875 and 1995.
While leisure (volwork) remains a relatively
small share of expanded consumption in 1875,


it accounts for two-thirds of expanded consumption
in 1995.'
The failure to include the value of volwork
in the national income and product accounts is
perhaps the most glaring example of the cultural
lag to which I referred at the beginning
of this address. That omission also leads to a
significant underestimate of the long-term
growth rate of per capita income. Before adjustments
for the increased quality of volwork,
the growth rate is increased by eight-tenths of
a point (from 1.8 to 2.6 percent per annum).
But adjustments for improvements in the quality
of volwork might substantially increase
that figure, since leisure-time activities in 1875
were limited largely to church on Sundays and
carousing in bars during the rest of the week
(cf., Fogel, 2000). Despite some important
contributions to the development of an economics
of leisure (cf., Gary S. Becker, 1991;
Costa, 1998a, c; Daniel S. Hamermesh, 1998;
John Pencavel, 1998), the profession has far
to go before it catches up with the economy.

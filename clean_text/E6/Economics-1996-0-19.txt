to pay attention to costs, and physicians will
also be interested in making a good income,
but there is a vast difference between a profit-
maximizing corporation and physicians who
strive to balance their obligations to patients,
the organization, and themselves.46
Reimbursement of these integrated systems
should be primarily by capitation, adjusted
for patient characteristics. In addition, pa-
tients should be required to make modest co-
payments at the time of use (e.g., $15 for each
visit and $5 for each prescription). Such pay-
ments will generate some income but, more
important, will help to discourage wasteful use
of health care. The payments could be waived
for patients living below the poverty level,
and for essential preventive services such as
vaccination.
The earmarked tax would provide every
American with a voucher for a basic health
care plan. Each integrated system would be
required to offer the basic plan, plus a variety
of options. These options are not alternative
insurance plans; they are services to be paid
for at time of use with after-tax dollars.47 The
options could take many forms: a private room
in the hospital; a wider choice of physicians
and hospitals than is available through the ba-
sic plan; or access to new experimental tech-
nologies or older technologies not included in
the basic plan because they have a low benefit-
to-cost ratio.48
These options would accommodate the de-
mands of patients with higher incomes or
those who choose to spend more of their in-
come on medical care. The options would not
constitute establishment of different plans. Ev-
eryone would be in the same plan and most
persons would stick to the basic plan most of
the time. An option would be exercised only
when the patient desired and was willing to
pay for it. This is the quintessential American
approach to balancing equality and freedom.
On the one hand, this approach avoids the
egalitarianism of the English and Canadian
systems in which only a small elite have an
escape valve. On the other hand, it does not
create a separate plan for the poor while the
great majority of Americans obtain care from
a different system. The experience with Med-
icaid shows that a separate system limited to
the poor is not likely to function well.
Where feasible, the integrated health care
system would engage in managed competi-
tion.49 Having advocated policies similar to
such an approach to health care for more than
20 years (Fuchs, 1974a), I am not unmindful
of its virtues. We cannot, however, rely on
managed competition alone to contain costs.
In most rural areas, population density is too
low to support several health care systems.
Even in some urban areas, competition is im-
possible or undesirable because of economies
of scale. For instance, only one hospital is
needed to serve a population of 100,000 effi-
ciently. Similar constraints apply to competi-
tion in physician specialty care, especially if
the physicians work full time at their special-
ties. A population of 1 million would probably
not justify enough independent maternity ser-
vices or open-heart surgery teams to create
competitive conditions. Moreover, the public
interest is not best served by insisting that
health professionals always maintain rigorous
arm' s-length competition with one another.
Patients can benefit from cooperation among
physicians and hospitals, both in reduced costs
and better service. Managed competition alone
will not be enough to contain costs; it must be  46 The effects on television network news departments
of the subordination of professional norms to the pursuit
of profits shows what could happen in medical care.
4 Readers whose values lead them to prefer a more
egalitarian system might consider how individuals now
have options to use their income to live in safer neigh-
borhoods, drive safer cars, avoid unhealthy occupations,
and make other choices that have larger and more pre-
dictable effects on health than the options available in my
recommendation for health care.
48 Many advances in medicine do not spring full-blown
from the test tube. They require long periods of develop-
ment through trial and error and incremental improve-
ments. In my judgment it is desirable to have a system in
which technologic opportunities can be explored on a rea-
sonably large scale with the cQsts borne by those patients
who are most willing and able to pay for a chance at un-
proven benefits. Government- or industry-financed ran-
domized clinical trials with small samples of selected
patients treated in selected environments are not always a
satisfactory substitute for larger scale efforts to establish
the effectiveness, and especially the cost-effectiveness of
a medical technology.

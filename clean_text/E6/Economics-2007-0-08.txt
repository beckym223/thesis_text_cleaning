a gap between their conception of how they
should behave and riding the merry-go-round.
However much they may enjoy it, they also feel
the need to distance themselves from an activity
that is so age inappropriate. They manifest this
distance by riding a frog, rather than a "serious"
animal like a horse; alternatively they show off
by standing up "dangerously" during the ride. In
some way or other they play the clown.
Behavior at the merry-go-round is, of course,
just the stuff of kids. But Goffman supplements
it with a totally serious example. In surgical
operations, because of their inexperience, medical
students are given tasks that are ridiculously
easy.17 They respond in the same way as the
older children at the merry-go-round: they also
act the clown.18
In economics, as elsewhere, $500 bills do not
just lie on the street. If living up to norms is
such an important motivation, it must show up
in many economic examples, even if it is not
identified in exactly our language. Gary S.
Becker's Economics of Discrimination (1957)
offers an example of now-standard economics
that can also be interpreted in terms of such
norms. Becker's theoretical innovation was to
modify plain-vanilla economic utility by the
introduction of a discrimination coefficient. He
defined that as the loss in utility incurred by
exchange with someone from a different racefor
example, the loss of a white from an exchange
with a black. The natural interpretation
is that the discrimination coefficient represents
the loss in utility for the white from physically
engaging in an exchange with a black. But this
representation of the utility function can also be
interpreted in terms of norms. There is a code as
to how blacks and whites should behave toward
each other. The white has a view that she should
not deal with a black. She loses utility equal to
the value of the discrimination coefficient-not
from the physical association-but ipso facto
from the violation of the code. There is reason
to believe that such norm-based interpretation
better reflects the nature of discrimination than
a physical exchange-based theory. In the preCivil
Rights period, when Becker was writing,
there can be no doubt that discrimination, and
the code that upheld it, was stronger in the
South than in the North. Yet exchanges between
blacks and whites were surely much more com-
mon in the South than in the North. At least one
statistic reflects such a difference: there were
significantly lower levels of residential segregation
by race in the South than in the North.
B. Summary
Our examples are illustrative of behavior that
is pervasive. Sociology is dense in examples of
people's views as to how they and others should
behave, their joy when they live up to those
standards, and their discomfort and reactions
when they fail to do so.
We now turn to examining the role of
norms in each of the five macroeconomic neutralities.

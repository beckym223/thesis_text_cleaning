am overweight, cut down my drinking, or
quit smoking." We cannot very easily cure
inflation if we are told that we cannot touch
import quotas and tariffs, price supports, a
variety of entrenched monopolies and anticompetitive
and other costly regulative interventions
in the economy. But we can pride
ourselves on rigorous application of our often
finely honed tools of analysis and our
ability to offer sound policy advice, whether
it is followed or not.

So I would not want my remarks this
evening to be taken as a mea culpa, for
myself or for our profession. But we are not
perfect, and I have endeavored to alert
us-or recall our attention to-certain critical
failings that keep us further from perfection
than we should be.

I have hence noted some pitfalls in using
current and past variables in analyses that
depend critically upon expectations of the
future. I have warned of confusion in employing
narrowly defined measures of income
and product in evaluating flows and
trends in comprehensive earnings and output.
I have argued that particularly large
dangers abound in basing policy on conventional
measures of private and public saving,
investment and capital. I have suggested that
usual estimates of some of the critical behavioral
relations of macroeconomics may be
suspect because of a failure to match theoretical
constructs with appropriate empirical
counterparts.

Very generally, I conclude, it is important
in economics-as elsewhere-to know what
we are talking about.29

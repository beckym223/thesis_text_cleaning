am overweight, cut down my drinking, or
quit smoking." We cannot very easily cure
inflation if we are told that we cannot touch
import quotas and tariffs, price supports, a
variety of entrenched monopolies and anti-
competitive and other costly regulative inter-
ventions in the economy. But we can pride
ourselves on rigorous application of our of-
ten finely honed tools of analysis and our
ability to offer sound policy advice, whether
it is followed or not.
So I would not want my remarks this
evening to be taken as a mea culpa, for
myself or for our profession. But we are not
perfect, and I have endeavored to alert
us-or recall our attention to-certain criti-
cal failings that keep us further from perfec-
tion than we should be.
I have hence noted some pitfalls in using
current and past variables in analyses that
depend critically upon expectations of the
future. I have warned of confusion in em-
ploying narrowly defined measures of in-
come and product in evaluating flows and
trends in comprehensive earnings and out-
put. I have argued that particularly large
dangers abound in basing policy on conven-
tional measures of private and public saving,
investment and capital. I have suggested that
usual estimates of some of the critical behav-
ioral relations of macroeconomics may be
suspect because of a failure to match theo-
retical constructs with appropriate empirical
counterparts.
Very generally, I conclude, it is important
in economics-as elsewhere-to know what
we are talking about.29
29I should not close without suggesting that of com-
plimentary importance is having the data to talk about.
At the risk of increasing that budget deficit, however we
measure it (or reducing the surplus), it would seem
appropriate, in line with the report of the American
Economic Association Committee on Federal Statistics
(see Thomas Juster, 1988), to give the BEA and other
statistical agencies the resources to develop more of the
measures appropriate for economic analysis.

efficiency reasons to prefer the expenditure
tax and these need to be addressed. S
A basic difference between the income and
expenditure taxes is in the time perspective
of the two taxes. The perspective of the
income tax is relatively short run-a year or
several years to allow for short-run income
fluctuations. Consumption is more stable
than income and is alleged, therefore, to be a
better measure of long-term well-being. In
fact, under certain simplifying assumptions,
the bases of taxes on the discounted present
value of income and expenditure are the
same over a lifetime. Assuming perfect capi-
tal markets, constant discount rates that ap-
ply equally to all people under all circum-
stances, tax rates that are constant and
proportional, and no gifts and bequests, the
present values of lifetime expenditures of
people with the same (discounted) lifetime
incomes are the same regardless of when the
incomes are consumed.26
Advocates of the expenditure tax regard
the lifetime perspective as a major advastage
because it permits them to pretend that tax-
ing consumption is equivalent to taxing per-
sonal endowments. A tax on endowments, if
they could be measured, would avoid the
distortionary effects of either an income tax
or an expenditure tax. If it is assumed that
lifetime consumption approximates exidow-
ment, then taxing consumption at flAtXand
constant rates treats equally all taxpayers
with the same endowment.27 The totaly' un-
realistic assumptions underlying this line of
reasoning strain credulity, but it doestteem
to lie behind the strong support for thQ ex-
penditure tax by many economists.
The lifetime perspective has little merit
even without the endowment rationale. In
my view, it is difficult enough to measure
economic circumstances over relatively short
periods. Taxation of lifetime consumption
(or income) hardly seems appropriate in a
world of changing tax rates, substantial fam-
ily instability, economic and political change,
and uncertainty. Except for the attractive-
ness of the arithmetic, lifetime economic
circumstances as measured by discounted
lifetime incomes or consumption cannot be
regarded as satisfactory indexes of ability to
pay.28 Moreover, taxation of annual con-
sumption expenditures at graduated rates
would destroy the identity of lifetime taxes
of taxpayers with the same (discounted) life-
time incomes.
The expenditure tax is alleged to be supe-
rior to the income tax on the additional
ground that the income tax reduces the re-
turn on saving and therefore encourages cur-
rent as against future consumption. Even if
saving remained unchanged, the distortion
generates a welfare loss for consumers. It has
been pointed out by many economists that
this effect must be balanced against the wel-
fare cost of further distorting the choice
between labor and leisure. There is no theo-
retical basis for judging whether the welfare
gain from eliminating the intertemporal dis-
tortion of consumption would exceed the
welfare loss from increasing the intratempo-
ral distortion of the labor-leisure choice.29
A tax that omits saving from the tax base
can be shown to be the same as a tax apply-
ing only to labor income and exempting all
property income.30 Several expenditure tax

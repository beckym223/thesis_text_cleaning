reflected primarily the investment incentives
introduced in the 1960s and liberalized in
the 1970s and 1980s, as well as a reduction
in the profitability of the corporate sector.10
Since 1985, the distribution of tax burdens
has changed largely because of the enactment
of the landmark Tax Reform Act of
1986. This act increased the progressivity of
the tax system, most notably by raising the
personal exemptions, standard deductions,
and the earned income credit, and by shifting
about $25 billion of tax annually from
individuals to corporations. However, this
change in tax policy restored only a small
fraction of the progressivity lost in the preceding
two decades. At the very top of the
income distribution, the 1986 federal tax reform
restored about half the reduction in
effective tax rates between 1980 and 1985,
but left them far below the 1966 levels: the
top 1 percent paid only 26.8 percent in taxes
in 1988 as compared with 39 percent in 1970
(Table 3).
The inescapable conclusion from these
figures is that the well-to-do in our society
had very large reductions in tax rates in
recent years, while the tax rates at the low
and middle income levels have not changed
much. Since the before-tax distribution has
become much more unequal in the 1980s, it
follows that inequality has increased even
more on an after-tax basis.'1
Transfer Payments. The other major element
of government policy affecting the distribution
of income is the system of transfer
payments, or negative taxes. This system in-

before-tax distributions reflect the responses of taxpay-  ers, through portfolio shifts, substitution of nontaxable
fringe benefits for cash compensation, and other actions,
to the level and structure of the tax system.
Hence, the after-tax distribution is more representative
of the changes in inequality. For a discussion of these
issues, see Eugene Steuerle (1985) and Harvey Galper,
Robert Luce, and Eric Toder (1988).

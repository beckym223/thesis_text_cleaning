have to be deployed with the sad deficiencies
of knowledge which, in so many spheres,
is the case today. Nor should we have
to bring feelings and knowledge to bear
through political institutions and procedures
which are as imperfect as those through
which we -now act.
When Keynes spoke of the potential efficiency
of a "wisely managed" capitalism,
he was assuming that the knowledge necessary
for wise management was either in
hand or would be forthcoming. But he did
not seem to be thinking about the limitations
of the political process in bringing
knowledge to bear. Now that economists
and other social scientists have begun to
work at it, we can be cautiously hopeful that
our knowledge about both the tradeoffs and
the complementarities between productivity
growth and the other dimensions of economic
welfare will gradually improve. For
the calculable future, however, our limited
political capabilities may well prove to be
the most binding constraint on our ability to
work out a social organization which, as
Keynes said, "shall be as efficient as possible
without offending our notions of a
satisfactory way of life."
Contemplating these obdurate realities,
what can one say to conclude this talk on an
upbeat note? The best I can do is a somewhat
inspirational passage from a lecture by
Jacob Viner, who, as we all know, was no
flaming New Dealer, no Great Society man,
and no Keynesian. I am fond of this passage,
not only because of its sturdy determination,
but also because it displays so
well Viner's precise but involuted mind, and
his amiable weakness for the nonstop
sentence. At the close of a long critique of
the American welfare state, which is the
mixed economy I have been talking about,

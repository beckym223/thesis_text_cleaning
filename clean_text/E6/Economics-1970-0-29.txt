recorded, but who for various reasons have
not become included. Among these we have
inter alia the "independent" inventors
whose role in the innovating process remains
important yet whose weight for our cost
calculus is small." Another group of con-
.siderable importance but of small weight for
the present purpose consists of those engaged
in market research, quality-control, and
product-testing (these are not included in the
R & D statistics).
The weight of some of the subcategories in
item 6) has probably increased and that of
others decreased over the past decades. The
weight of those who have remained un-
recorded merely becauise of the technical
deficiencies or recording procedures must
have somewhat decreased even if we com-
pare the mid-fifties with the present.
7) Last but not least, the entrepreneurial
input and its clerical complement, inter-
preted as the input required for preparing
and making the top decisions on techno-
logical and organization change. This is
obviously an 'elusive' item and one of small
weight in the present context, though of
crucial significance.
APPENDIX D
(see Section VI)
Reminder of Controversial Structural
Problems in the Area of R & D-Policy
Somewhat more than 30 percent of the
Federal R & D obligations for the fiscal year
1966 were those of NASA; about 45 percent
consisted of those of the Defense Department
(this undoubtedly included items not directly
related to military objectives in the narrower
sense); between 5 percent and 10 percent
were obligations of the Atomic Energy
Commission; and between 5 percent and 10
percent those of HEW, mainly for public
health. Neither the main part of this paper
nor the present Appendix contains detailed
numerical information for the past three
years because the preliminary data for these
years are apt to become revised; the reader
should therefore be reminded of the fact that
in 1966 space research reached a peak,
though it has been a very weighty item of the
government's R & D budget for the decade
of the sixties as a whole. On my own list of
priorities space exploration stands high and
I value the Giant Leap of July 20, 1969 ac-
cordingly. But one should not pretend to
express a professional judgment as an
economist when attaching values to alterna-
tive amounts so allocated.
From 1953 to 1966 about two-thirds of the
total recorded R & D was financed by the
Federal government."7 Industry performed
about 70 percent of the total recorded R & D,
while the remaining 30 percent was per-
formed by the government itself and by
other nonprofit institutions, including uni-
versities. The large discrepancy between the
public-to-private ratio in financinzg, on the
one hand, and in performance on the other,
reflects the circumstances that the Federal
government has typically financed about
55 percent of the R & D which was per-
formed by industry (less in the first few
years of the period 1953-1966, and slightly
less also after 1966).
The typical share of Aircraft and Missiles
in the total R & D performed by industry has
been one-third or more, and the share of
Electrical Equipment and Communication
about one-fourth. This adds up to nearly
60 percent for the two leading performers
among the industries. If we add Chemicals
and Allied Products, Machinery (other than
electrical), and Motor Vehicles-each of
these three with shares falling somewhat
short of 10 percent- we are up to about 85
percent of the total, for five "industries" as
defined by the NSF.58
86 See John Jewkes, David Sawers, and Richard
Stillerman.
In the beginning of the period the government  financed less than two-thirds, and after 1966 somewha'  less.
58 In a sense it is more revealing to add Petroleum
Refining and Extraction and Professional and Scientific
Instruments to the five leaders (which raises the joint
share of the "leaders" so extended to somewhat more
than 90 percent), because if we rank the industries by
R&D in relation to Value Added, then these two indus-
tries are in the same range as the lower two of the top  five. The seven leaders produce almost 17 percent of the
U.S. national income.
We should note that the individual "industries"
distinguished by the NSF are sometimes composites of

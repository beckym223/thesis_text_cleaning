ciplines. We should begin with the defusing
of jargon. Perhaps some terms should be
explained at first use. To the physicist who
has used calculus on problems going back
to Isaac Newton, it is unexpected to learn
that everything called "marginal" is a first
derivative of something. It appears natural
to him, however, to learn that an "elasticity"
is the dimensionless slope of a curve
plotted on double-log paper. There is more
trouble lying in wait with "externalities,"
an institutional concept presupposing private
property, or at least an accountability
for private or public production or household
decisions that is dispersed over individuals
and organizations. If we will be
more forthcoming with explanations of our
cherished terms, our science colleagues may
be more inclined to help us out with "entropy,
" which to me is a more difficult concept
than anything economics has to offer.
A more serious problem is that, while our
universities are the principal training ground
for future scientists of all kinds, they do not
seem to be the best place for gaining experience
in interdisciplinary interaction. I
believe that the root of the difficulty lies in
the procedures for academic appointment
and promotion. The initiative, the decisive
first step, is usually taken in the department
of one's own discipline. Young faculty
members must prove their worth first to
their senior colleagues in the field they are
identified with. A joint appointment holds
somewhat less promise as a stepping stone
to tenure. Even our graduate students are
already aware of these factors.
The increasing demand for the contributions
of interdisciplinarians may gradually
break the barriers down. Progress will be
slow unless university faculties and administrations
perceive the problem. Once they
do, the irrepressible curiosity and venturesomeness
of our undergraduates will provide
a point at which to start and from
which to build up.

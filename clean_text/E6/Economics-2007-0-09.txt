people's views as to how they should behave
will enter their utility function. In each case, we
shall see that such views will nullify the respec-
tive neutrality result. Indeed, we shall also see
that in each case there will be a natural norm
broadly consistent with Keynesians' views of  economic behavior.21
IV. Ricardian Equivalence
We shall begin our detailed discussion with
Ricardian equivalence. It was chronologically
the last of the neutralities to be appreciated by
modern economists. But it is also the simplest.
That makes it the best place to begin.22 If there
is missing motivation in the utility function, it
should be easiest to see here.
A very simple model demonstrates the es-
sence of Ricardian equivalence, as it was redis-
covered by Robert Barro after a lapse of almost
two centuries.23 In the model, there are just two
periods, periods 1 and 2. There are just two
people, a parent and her child. The utility of the
parent depends directly upon her own consump-
tion, in period 1; it also depends upon the utility
of her child. That utility depends upon his con-
sumption, in period 2.
The parent's utility function can be expressed
simply as U,(cl, U2(c2)), where c1 is the con-
sumption of the parent, C2 is the consumption of
the child, U, is the utility of the parent, and U2  is the utility of the child. The parent chooses her
consumption in period 1 to maximize her utility.
Whatever wealth remains, she bequeaths to her  child.
Ricardian equivalence takes the following form
in this model. Suppose that the government
gives a transfer, which we shall call a social
security payment, to the parent in period 1; but
then in period 2 it taxes the child to retire the
debt caused by this transfer.24 In this case, the
consumption of a parent who maximizes the
utility function U, and who leaves a bequest to
her child will be unaffected by her receipt of
social security.
The logic of this result is simple. With and
without social security the discounted value of
consumption of the parent and of the child is
constrained by the discounted value of the fam-
ily's earnings (plus its initial wealth). Social
security leaves that constraint unchanged. If the
parent found (c,, c2) to be the optimal division
of consumption between herself and her child in
the absence of a social security payment, this
same division of consumption between herself
and her child will optimize her utility with a
social security payment.
A vast literature explains why such Ricardian
equivalence is unlikely to be empirically de-
scriptive.25 The long list of reasons includes (a)
infinite, rather than finite, horizons; (b) strategic
bequests to obtain the attention of one's heirs
while alive; (c) childless families; (d) uncer-
tainty, including bequests made because of un-
certainty about the age of death; (e) differential
borrowing rates between the government and
the public; (f) growth of the economy in excess
of the interest rate, allowing steady debt issu-
ance; (g) lack of foresight regarding the effect
of social security on future taxes; (h) foreign
ownership of debt; (i) tax distortions;26, 27, 28 (j)  Phelps. He has summarized for me the content of that talk
in an e-mail.  21 For each of the five neutralities we see that the inclu-
sion of broader preferences, inclusive of norms, will bring  Keynesian behaviors back to life. But, of course, that does
not mean that the competitive forces and the maximizing  behaviors responsible for the five neutralities are not im-  portant as well.  22 That appreciation is of course due to Barro (1974).  23 This model is quite close to Ricardo's original discus-  sion. It is a considerable simplification of Barro's model.  His model had a sequence of overlapping generations, each  of which lived for two periods. Barro's contribution was not
only to show Ricardian equivalence in the two-generation  model, but also its extension to a sequence of generations  when parents' utility depended only on their own utility and  the utility of their own children. Ricardo's discussion,  which is close to the two-generation model here, was then  subsequently rediscovered. There is no uncertainty, and all  taxes are lump-sum. This proposition may be generalized,  for example, following Barro, to a model with m overlap-  ping generations, each of which has different consumption  when young and old. Each parent derives utility from his  own consumption and the utility of his child.  24 The tax and the transfer are both lump-sum.  25 The conventional wisdom is, of course, that social
security will affect aggregate savings. Martin Feldstein  (1974) and Feldstein and Anthony Pellechio (1979) act as if  increases in social security of the current generation will  result in increased consumption, so that the next generation  will have a lower capital stock.
26 I take this list mainly from the review article by John  J. Seater (1993).
27 Barro (1989) also gives a careful review of the frictional  reasons why Ricardian equivalence may not in fact occur.  28 In the case of strategic bequests, the bequest is an  unusual form of incentive payment for a service rendered.

individuals and families.33 So my answers here
are speculative and primarily meant to identify
where research might lead us to policy
improvements.
Offhand, the maximum rule does not provide
labor incentives well (incentives are stronger for
workers who have spouses likely to collect aux-
iliary benefits since two benefits are increased
by more earnings, and weaker for workers who
are likely to receive a larger spouse benefit since
further earnings by someone receiving a spouse
benefit do not increase that benefit). A similar
(but less extreme) issue arises with income tax-
ation of a lower-earning spouse.
Offhand, the cost of auxiliary benefits should
be shared between a worker and the program as
a whole. The benefit formula is progressive,
with a higher replacement rate for lower earn-
ers, reflecting differences in retirement needs.
As part of responding to needs, it seems right to
recognize dependents in determining need and
so benefits. But the current rule is not the only
way to do that. Some provision of auxiliary
benefits for children from the general program
makes sense, in keeping with our generalized
support of children in education; some provi-
sion for spouses is relevant in the role of
progressivity-two can not live as cheaply as
one. But the current system has gone too far and
I share in the criticism that too much is given to
the nonworking spouses of high earners.34 Us-
ing system resources to finance large transfers
to those in the upper tier of the earnings distri-
bution offsets too much of the progressivity in
other portions of the system. Designing a dif-
ferent system would be politically sensitive and
complex and would need detailed analysis.
The determination of survivor benefits has
also received considerable criticism. Recogniz-

ing the role of couples in sharing resources at
least partially, it makes sense to relate the ben-
efits of an elderly survivor to the benefits that
had been received by the couple-a survivor
replacement rate. Currently, survivor replace-
ment rates vary with the past earnings of hus-
band and wife, usually, but not always, between
one-half and two-thirds.35 A uniform survivor
replacement rate seems more likely to approxi-
mate relative needs than the current system. The
much higher poverty rate of widows than of
couples, noted above, suggests a higher survi-
vor replacement rate is needed, with three-
quarters having been suggested by some
analysts.36 The change to a uniform and higher
survivor replacement rate could be financed out of
a suitable mix of the total resources of the program
and the benefits of the couple while both are alive.
The current recognition of divorce is to allow
benefits for unremarried divorced spouses and di-
vorced surviving spouses after at least ten years of
marriage. Since there is a family maximum, some
of these benefits are paid by the system as a whole
and some out of the other auxiliary benefits. The
adaptation of the system for the growth in divorce
seems to me a major issue for research. I do not
know if we can design a system that would be
better, recognizing both labor market incentives
and income distribution issues, or if such a design
could survive political hurdles.37 But it is worth
thinking hard about.

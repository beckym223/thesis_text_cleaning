There are equally evidlent weaknesses; the waste involvc(l in competition;
the in equiality of opportunity and bargaining power, due
to the unequal distribution of wealth, wlich tends to the formation
of econiomiiic classes and leaves potential capacity undeveloped;
the conflict over the distribution of the product of industry aind
the consequent sense of opposition of interests between those upon
whose hearty cooperation the efficiency of industry depends; the
opportunity to gain wealth through the suppression of competition
and the establishing of monopoly rather than by economic
service; the more or less haphazard character of our industrial adjustments,
involvinig waste and giving rise to alternating periods
of prosperity and depression; the lack of motive in the present
generation for safeguarding the interests of future generations;
this is but a partial list of weaknesses long recognized.
That muclh lias been done to eliminate these weaknesses and mitigate
their evil results I hlave no thought of denying, but, unfortunately

voice in our indcustrial affairs and have prospered most under the
existing system. have been content to let matters drift so far as
the imiost serious probleims of industrial organization are concerned.

education, and organization, these masses have acquired a definiteness
of purpose atnd a power which compels a thoroughgoinig considerationi
and possible reconstruction of our industrial systein, if
its stability is to be preserved.

Aimid the flood of radical proposals which abouind in a period
of world disorganization such as the present it is doubtless easy to
exaggerate the strength of the tendency to fundamental changes
in our social system. Those who are agitating for change are
articuilate and insistenit, but it is difficult to estimate the power
by whiclh they are backed in comparison with the inertia of the
kess articulate masses of the population. It would be foolish, however,
to close our eyes to the possibility of raidical changes in ouir
in(lustrial structure. Outr econom-ic system is exempt from clhange

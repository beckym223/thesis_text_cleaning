was clearly perceived. It was then widely believed, however, that, although
business-men admittedly found abhorrent the impact upon themselves of
other persons' competition and grasped every opportunity to escape it,
monopolistic power could not come into being on a large scale, or at least
could not long maintain itself, except with government aid and sanction.
In justice to those who were of this view, it should be noted that the
grant of a corporate charter was then universally regarded as the grant of a
special privilege potentially dangerous to society, and it was therefore then
assumed as a matter of course that such grants would be made only sparingly
and would be jealously circumscribed, in each specific instance, by
restrictions as to permitted size, nature and range of activities, and right
of participation in the civil liberties enjoyed by genuine individuals.
Whether now, after several generations of unrestrained grant of corporate
charters and of great development of mass-production requiring large
economic units for its operation, it is still possible, through proper regulation
and restriction by government of the activities of large corporations, to
restore an essentially competitive price system, is a question to which I
freely confess I do not see a clear answer, although I look forward eagerly
for much-needed enlightenment to those sessions of this meeting where this
question will be discussed by an exceptionally-qualified group who, I have
reason to know, have been giving it very serious and disinterested consideration.
The only point I wish to make now is that the old dogma,
that monopoly power is basically the product of governmentally protected
or sanctioned special privilege and will not survive on a large scale if such
special privilege is withdrawn or kept to its practically minimal limits,
still has sufficient plausibility to warrant further inquiry. It seems to me
a reasonable hypothesis, one worth examination, for instance, that if much
of the impressive array of governmental encouragements to monopoly
could be removed, or, where removal was impracticable, if government
regulation were directed to foster cyclical patterns of price-behavior following
the competitive pattern, the chief evil product of monopoly, the
price-inflexibility problem, would shrink to easily tolerable dimensions.
Consider for instance, some of the elements in the prevailing pattern of
government relationship to monopoly and to price-inflexibility. Promiscuous
issue of wide-open corporate charters by the states; until within the
last year or two slack and faint-hearted enforcement of the anti-trust laws,
already gutted by court sabotage; protection of monopolistic price-structures
by the federal tariff; positive encouragement of monopolistic pricepractices
by such legislation as the N.R.A. act, the Webb-Pomerene act,
the Guffey Coal act; so-called "fair-trade" laws which compel businessmen
to act as if they were monopolists even if they wish not to; concealed
protection of monopoly by doctored building and other ordinances; tacit
encouragement to monopoly through acceptance in government contracts,

which are made for its investment and management except
to protect their citizens against monopolistic price policies.
Industrial leaders are at times unable to solve the problems which
arise from excessive competition, as we know from recent failures to
agree on a policy of restricted production by the oil, steel, sugar, and
rubber interests; but in these cases competition is always at work to bring
about an agreement later when the failure to agree means continued overproduction
and unprofitable prices.
It must not be forgotten that the policy of laissez-faire was first
announced and subsequently developed in the field of international trade
and while the intervening years have witnessed many departures
from it by the nations of the world, economists in general have continued
to give it their support within this sphere of action. Attacks upon the
principle have for the most part been made when its extreme advocates
have sought to justify it as a regulating force in the struggle between
labor and capital or that between producer and consumer. In the field
of international economics the striiggle is not likely to be less intense,
but it will be short-lived; and it may well serve as a satisfactory substitute
for international conflicts of a more sanguinar'y nature.

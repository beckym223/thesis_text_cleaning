he advocates, in characteristically guarded language, that the functions
of the Railroad Labor Board be transferred to a labor division of an
enlarged interstate commerce commission, that its decisions be given
the force of law, and that railroad strikes be prohibited.
It was no accident that the same winter in which Congress passed
the Transportation act in face of the determined opposition of the
leaders of organized labor, Kansas, under the forceful guidance of
Governor Allen, adopted her Industrial Court law. This affords even
clearer evidence of the inevitable trend of governmental policy toward
labor controversies on public service industries. The Kansas act not
only creates a court with broad powers to regulate wages, hours, and
working conditions when in dispute in industries affected with a public
interest, but prescribes more clearly than the Transportation act what
standard of just and reasonable rates the court is to apply to wages
and working conditions, and prohibits with severe penalties strikes
or other concerted efforts to interrupt the continuous operation of
such industries.
It would be a bold prophet who would attempt to predict just what
developments in our governmental policy toward public service in-
dustries lie immediately before us. In the see-saw of politics, President
Harding's recommendations may be disregarded and Governor Allen's
beloved Court may be abolished. But I venture the opinion that what-
ever course the legislation of the immediate future may take, the logic
of the situation will as time goes on lead us to strengthen rather than
weaken the machinery for insuring continuous operation of public
service industries. This means the maintenance of an authoritative
board or court to determine labor conditions on the railroads and of
similar state boards or courts to determine conditions on street rail-
ways and other local public service industries. It means the formula-
tion in statutes of the standards as regards wages and working condi-
tions that are to be required in connection with public service industries.
Finally it means prohibition with enforceable penalties (not imprison-
ment4 but fines which pursue the offender until paid, as in New Zealand)

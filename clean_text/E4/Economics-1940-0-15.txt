or desire that such a hearing would lead to a cessation or even slowingup
of the present endeavors to find remedies for prevailing evils through
positive government action. Obedience to some of the old dogmas would
in fact lead to an intensification of governmental action. As far as I am
concerned, I have been much more impressed by the undue inertia of
government in the face of acknowledged evils than by its rash venturesomeness
in action, although I think I have seen both qualities displayed.
It is not a middle way between action and inaction, therefore, which I
urge. It has been said that throughiout all the history of man Confucius
alone succeeded in making the middle way either emotionally exciting or
intellectually stimulating, and I have my doubts even about Confucius. As
many persons who appeal to the middle way use the term, it really becomes
a disguised plea that we should halt between the premises and their
conclusions. That is not what I am pleading for. Let evils be dealt with,
promptly and decisively. But in choosing the manner and direction of
action, let us pay heed to the old as well as the new wisdom, and let us
especially beware of old poisons in new bottles.

In 1763 the British government issued the Royal Proclamation which
forbade English colonists to settle west of the Allegheny mountains
except by special permission, a prohibition which stirred the ill will of
men of Massachusetts and Virginia alike and contributed to the creation
of the growing discontent which finally culminated in the Revolution.
But even before that event the paper frontier thus set up had been
crossed by roving individuals and by bands of adventurous men who
settled in the forbidden territory. And after the treaty of peace between
Great Britain and the new republic, no obstacle prevented the westward
movement except physical barriers and the resistance of the Indians.
Neither of these was able to stem the resistless surge of restless settlers
as they pressed on into the valley of the Ohio and the land to the south.
The fortunate purchase of the Louisiana territory opened up new vistas
and led to the later wresting of coveted California from a weaker neighbor.
Now the only limit to the westward movement was the Pacific Ocean,
and within seventy-five years from the Revolution, this had been reached.
It is perhaps incorrect to speak of this process of filling up the land
with settlers as pushing back the frontier, for in the changing kaleidoscopic
picture there were many frontiers. There was the trappers' and
fur traders' frontier, far beyond the fixed habitations of men, a fluctuating
and retreating line which followed the disappearing fur-bearing
animals tinto the northwest and southwest, and then leaped the intervening
distances to the far west. The ranchers' frontier existed first
along the western fringe of the early colonies, but was pressed ever farther

seems likely to end peace. Then, in the years of post-war recovery,
we were told that the new economics had eliminated the business cycle;
and many believed these new prophets of the millenium. We have suffered
many disillusionments, and made many mistakes because we have succumbed
to the spell of ideals. Too frequently ideals misdirect the action
they inspire. It would seem then that the realism of the modern liberal
can contribute much to the discussion of current problems and exert a
wholesome influence upon contemporary social policy. Though it may
arouse less enthusiasm among the masses, it is a safer guide for party
leaders and for statesmen.

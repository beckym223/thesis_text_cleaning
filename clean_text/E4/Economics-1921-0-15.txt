But, after all, how, within the present institutional situation, with its
actual distribution of leverage and power, shall the democraticallyminded
masses hope for success? Revolutionary thinkers declare it to
be impossible, consistently with the orderly processes of political development.
My belief-my faith, if you please-is other. I hold
that it is precisely through the progressive understanding and the enlightened
decision of the classes with which this power land leverage
lic-through their growing recognition of the ways of wisdom, of obligation,
of provident adjustment and of sagacious coiiperation-that
the thing will come. And if it does not so come, it will be solely that
the wisdom has been lacking to face fairly what the alternative will
mean. Now, as always in soci-al problems, the primary need is to
understand.

The first task, then, of political and economic sagacity I take to be
the retirement of these debts-through the assertion of the claim to
all further emerging increments upon the social estates, through income
and inheritance taxes, through severely high excises on middlemen
activities, and even, if need were, as in Europe need actually is,
through capital levies. If we allow the evils resulting from the war to
run on, unmitigated, the consequences in social unrest, in lowered labor
morale, in extravagant and destructive radicalism, in riot and, it may
be, in attempted revolution, will cost us-and will cost all of usvastly
more than a courageous and even heroic settlement of our problems
now with the means at hand. Always and everywhere it is for each
present generation to protect rather than to impair the resources of
the coming generations and to foster rather than to mar their liberties.

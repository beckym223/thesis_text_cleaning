and that the elabora-le system of exchange and finance which has
been built up is but a piece of mechanism for the furtherance of
this end.
On the basis of our war experience it is easy to make clear that
our power of productioni is limited; that if we would increase the
production of certain goods, we must economize our consumption
of others; that economy in consumption, saving, is the essential
condition of the creation of capital; that war finance is the placing
of the labor and capital of the country at the disposal of the government;
that financial operations are not an independent means,
but merely the mechanism for accomplishing this purpose; and
that the slogan, "business as usual," in the face of a great national
emergency which diminishes our labor force and requires the diversion
of labor into new lines of industry is an evident fallacy.
On the whole, economists need not be discouraged by results of
the test to which generally accepted principles of economics have
been subjected by the war.
It is certain that we have much to learn concerning the influences
which govern human action, but there seems no reason to believe
that we have erred in assuming that laborers prefer the job
that yields the highest pay; that sellers desire to sell in the dearest
and buyers to buy in the cheapest market; that the organizers
of business seek the industries which promise the largest returns
over expenses of production; that men desire to escape, if possible,
the competition of others supplying or consuming like goods and
services; that the utilization of limited natural resources is subject
to the law of diminishing returns; or that goods or services
are valued on the basis of their marginal utilities.
So long as these assumptions remain true, and men are allowed
free choice of occupations and left to determine their relations
to each other by mutual agreement among themselves, the outline
of the theory of exchange and distribution will remain what it is
although additional knowledge will enable us to fill in the outline
more completely than is now possible.
Our social institutions are subject to change and these changes
bring changes in the structure and working of our economic system.
It is of great importance to understand the course and effects
of such changes, but it is equally important to understand
the working of the economic system under the institutions that
exist. Except for considerations of stability and uniformity in
our economic nomenclature it does not seem to be of vital impor-

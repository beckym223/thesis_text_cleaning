the government. Had we been operating in the past few years undex
real danger of a deficit, a substantial proportion of these cases would
have been cleaned up, to the great benefit of both the Treasury and the
taxpayers concerned.
The taxpayer cannot be content to let statistics determine how much
future revenues will be; he wants to have a hand in making and moulding
those statistics. He cannot permit fiscal officials to determine of
and by themselves what kinds and rates of taxes are expedient. I have
said elsewhere that it is essential to the right solution of such questions
that taxpayers pull at the coat tails of distinguished statesmen and say,
insistently, what they believe they can and ought to pay. Tax-making
is only in part a matter of thinking; it is in large part a balance of
powers and forces. The fiscal official himself has an interest at stake,
which leads him-if unchecked-to play excessively safe. Moreover,
legislators and fiscal officials make their decisions-both between expenditures
and tax reductions and between various groups of taxpayerswith
keen regard to the revealed power of the various contestants.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1927, over $1,100,000,000 of the
public debt was retired: over $500,000,000 from the sinking fund, and
over $600,000,000 from the surplus of $635,809,000 accumulated in
that year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1928, the sinking fund,
together with payments on obligations of the foreign governments, will
result in the retirement of approximately $537,000,000 of the public
debt, while the surplus will amount to $454,000,000, it is estimated,
making possible a total debt reduction approaching $1,000,000,000.
The public debt is now in the neighborhood of $18,500,000,000. Taking
into account the steady growth of the sinking fund, and the expected
increase in the payments on account of foreign obligations, the entire
public debt will be extinguished in less than fifteen years, if surpluses
appear in the future as they have in the past.
Trhe American taxpayer may ask-what then? Are we paying down
our debt at the rate of from $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 a year, in
order at the end of the process to cancel our foreign claims and exempt
the foreign taxpayer? Such a program is worthy of solemn consideration.
But it should be consciously adopted, if at all. It will do no
good suddenly to awaken to such an issue. To wipe out our debt and
then be asked to cancel the foreigners' debt to us, will lead to accusations
of deception and trickery. It will stir domestic controversy
that will complicate, and not simplify, our foreign problems.
The resistance of the taxpayer thus brings to light facts and issues
hidden in the mists of the future. It modifies those facts and issues. It
has been said of old: You shall seek the truth and the truth shall make
you uncomfortable. In taxation it may be said: You shall, in part, make
the issue and the truth, and in so doing you will be less uncomfortable.

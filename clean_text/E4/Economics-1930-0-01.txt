If the shoemaker is well-advised to stick to his last, the learned professions,
which in our day have inherited much of the medieval craftsman'
s ethics, may occasionally obey this precept. I may properly, therefore,
on this occasion make some random observations upon historical
records, the raw materials of my craft. Practically all the great variety
of records used by historians in general are also necessary to the economic
historian; and his technique in the use of these records is that
common to all historical criticism. But this branch of history has
chosen for its field that longitudinal section through the great mass of
material which is concerned primarily with economic activities and relationships.
Since the economic historian is vitally interested in the
past development of economic institutions and processes and their bearing
on present problems, he must also regard his work as a branch
of the science of economics. Fundamentally important, however,
as the economic factor appears to him, he does not regard it as the one
determining factor in human affairs past or present. Man does not
live by bread alone. And no active group of economic historians is
today making any such claim for the predominance of this specialism
as did the German "historical school," from Roscher and Hildebrand to
Schmoller.

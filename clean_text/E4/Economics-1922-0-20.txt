vulgar sense he will be saved; from the more subtle contagion of postwar
reaction he will not be immune.
But this need not be so. If the economist, tutored by his past,
maintain his full scientific stature, toiling laboriously in the assembly
of data, formulating trial hypotheses with caution, abstaining religiously
from armchair theorizing, subjecting tentative uniformatives
to rigid verification, fearless in the knowledge that is power-he will
preserve his scientific vantage with widening range and profounder
impress. By the sheer virtue of his scholarship, will he prevail upon
affairs.

the heavens. Today the most critical dilemma of modern industrialism is
how to acquire a greater degree of control over our economic system.
We must also effect a synthesis of usefulness and beauty, of learning and
life, of material achievement and art, of economics and ethics. Life is
after all one organic whole, and technology and culture are not and
should not be distinct. Mere material achievement is not a final goal. We
must provide a juster social organization, a civilization more appreciative
of and better able to use leisure, art, literature, the finer things of
the spirit, and higher ethical ideals.

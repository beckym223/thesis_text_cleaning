"1Lest I be misunderstood, I elaborate. This is not a plea for "Art for its own sake,"
"Logical elegance for the sake of elegance." It is not a plea for leaving the real-world
problems of political economy to noneconomists. It is not a plea for short-run popularity
with members of a narrow in-group. Rather it is a plea for calling shots as they really
appear to be (on reflection and after weighing all evidences), even when this means losing
popularity with the great audience of men and running against "the spirit of the times."

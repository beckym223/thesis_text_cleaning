come largely from superficial observation of the material circumstances
that surround us. Instead they should be hypotheses to be tested.
There are other questions that are particularly appropriate for ex-
ploration by economists who study contemporary institutions. What is
happening to the mobility of the factors of production as labor and capi-
tal become controlled by ever larger organizational units? What effect
are corporate-financed social security programs and union rules gov-
erning seniority and other conditions of employment having on the
mobility of labor? What effect is the corporation's interest in develop-
ing the well-rounded, loyal organization man, in preference to the non-
conformist of distinction, having on the supply and mobility of mana-
gerial talent? What can we learn about prices from the recent tendency
of corporations to finance expansion out of earnings without direct re-
course to financial markets? What are the factors that explain the ap-
parent anomaly of rising prices and declining production? Do the price
and investment policies of big business on balance inhibit rather than
promote the growth of output and investment? Do they result in a dis-
tribution of income incompatible with the fullest utilization of existing
productive facilities? Finally, and most important, to what extent can
the structure of industry be modified and the economy made more flexi-
ble without loss of efficiency? Can this be done through tax measures?
Can it be done through more selective and vigorous administration of
the antitrust laws? These are some of the questions with which stu-
dents of industrial structure might well be concerned. They are becom-
ing increasingly important to a free-enterprise economy in a world of
competitive co-existence.
Oliver Wendell Holmes once remarked, "Every now and then a
man's mind is stretched by a new idea . . . and never shrinks back to its
former dimensions" [15, p. 266]. It is to be hoped that the minds of
contemporary students of economic institutions that have now encom-
passed the corporate system may be sufficiently flexible to engender an
inquiring attitude about what it means and where it is leading us.

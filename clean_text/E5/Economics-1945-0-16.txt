the tasks call for. We must bravely face the prospect that nothing like
the full potentialities can be realized within calculable time. Even so,
there is ground for expecting that, in the next twenty to thirty years,
the planes of living of most of the world's peoples can be raised well
above the pre-war levels. Our own national interests are deeply involved
in translating this possibility into actual fact. The rate and degree of
progress in this direction will depend heavily upon the people and government
of the United States. And important contributions from economists
and other social scientists will be essential to sound progress
toward these reasonable goals.

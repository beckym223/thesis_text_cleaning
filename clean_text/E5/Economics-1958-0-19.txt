The reason for this is clear. The rights and freedoms of business
enterprises that are part of the legal foundation of our economic organiization
and that we have called counterparts because of their resemblance
to items in our bill of personal rights, differ sharply in one respect
from the bill-of-rights items. And that difference is a fundamental
one. We prize the items in our bill of rights for their own sakes. Our
personal freedom is an end in itself. But we prize the business-counterpart
rights and freedoms-what we call freedom of enterprise-because
they are part of the legal foundations of our economic organization.
They are means to an end, because the organization itself is a means to
an end-the end of getting the things done that we as individual human
beings want done.

We rightly prize our economic organization because it has proven to
be extraordinarily productive and progressive and has enabled us to
achieve an extraordinarily high level of living. But we do not prize it as
an end in itself. We should therefore be open-minded about possible
further restrictions of business freedoms and other changes in it-both
changes that will supplement and improve the way economic institutions
perform central-management functions and enhance our economy'
s productiveness and progressiveness and changes that will enlarge
and strengthen our personal freedoms. Twenty-five and more years ago
economists were devoting a good deal of attention to the kind of welfare
economics that is concerned with such changes in our free enterprise
system. It is high time to resume the active investigation of this
kind of welfare economics.

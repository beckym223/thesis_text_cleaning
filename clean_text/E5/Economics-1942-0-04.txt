' Part of the difficulties in housing must be attributed to unsatisfactory financial instru-
ments, particularly short-term second mortgages.
6 The extent to which the shifting of economic power and the imposition of new responsi-
bilities upon business caused short-term plans to be preferred to long-term plans is
roughly indicated by comparing for the two periods 1922-29 and 1933-39 expenditures
on equipment in relation to expenditures on plant. Since expenditures on equipment are
in large measure for replacement and expenditures on plant are in the main for the
enlargement of capacity, the change in the relation between the two roughly illustrates
the change in the importance of expenditures on long-run plans in relation to expenditures
on current needs. Between 1922 and 1929, 81.3 cents were spent by business enterprises
on plant for every dollar spent on equipment; between 1933 and 1939, only 44.5
cents were spent on plant for every dollar spent on equipment. Between 1922 and 1929,
expenditures on plant were 29,774 million dollars and on equipment 36,626 million
dollars; between 1933 and 1939, expenditures on plant were 10,850 million dollars and
on equipment 24,155 million dollars.

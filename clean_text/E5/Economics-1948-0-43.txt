' Some of the studies which badly need to be carried out are (1) to develop the produc-  tion function for each and every year over a long period, say 1910-1940, for Australia, New
Zealand, and Canada; (2) to carry on studies of the production function for a large  number of specific firms and within specific industries and hence connect the theory of the  firm and of the industry with that of the economy; (3) to carry on further studies, along
the lines of Mr. Olson, on inter-spatial variations in real income and the factors affecting
them; and (4) to develop production functions for agriculture, mining, and public utilities.  In order to bring our analysis down to date in the larger countries, it is highly desirable
that statistics on the quantities of capital be collected for Great Britain, Sweden, and the
United States.

number of employees and of the total quantities of fixed and working
capital with each industry serving as a separate observation. This is
obviously a somewhat different production function from that which is
based on the time series. The quantities of labor used are physical
quantities and though capital is expressed in value terms, these are
also rough measurements of relative physical amounts. But since
product is also expressed in value terms, this is the result not only of:
(a) changes in the increments to the total physical product but also
of (b) changes in the exchange value, or the relative price per unit of
the products of an industry. The net values turned out by the respective
industries will, therefore, be affected in these cases not only by
the quantities produced but also by the respective demand curves for
the products. Changes in each of these variables will affect the total
exchange value produced.

Some critics will, of course, object that this second type of study,
since it includes both quantities and prices, does not measure production
at all and is in no sense a test of marginal productivity theory. It
is certainly a somewhat different type of production function from
that which is based on index numbers of quantities. But marginal
productivity theory has always implicitly dealt in terms of values as
well as of physical quantities since it assumes that the supplies of labor
and capital in each of the various industries are regulated by the principle
that the respective marginal laborers will produce equal amounts
of value as will the marginal units of capital. In the apportionment
of resources within an economy, therefore, the principle of diminishing
incremental value productivity is an essential part of economic theory
and is worthy of consideration. There is no reason why a production
function which deals with it should not also be worthy of consideration
and treatment.

Although interrupted by the war, we now have completed six crosssection
or inter-industry studies for American manufacturing, namely,
for the years 1889, 1899, 1904, 1909, 1914, and 1919; four crosssection
studies for Canada covering the years 1923, 1927, 1935, and
1937; three studies for Victoria for the years 1910-11, 1923-24, and
1927-28; one study for New South Wales for 1933-34, and five studies
for the Commonwealth of Australia, namely, 1912, 1922-23, 1926-27,
1934-35, and 1936-37. Two of my students, Messrs. G. Brinegar and
K. 0. Campbell, have just finished such a study for Queensland for
1937-38, and two more, Messrs. B. Solomon and N. A. Deif, are
completing another study for New Zealand for 1926-27. In all, therefore,
twenty-one cross-section studies have been carried through by
our Chicago group to add to our previous four time studies, namely,

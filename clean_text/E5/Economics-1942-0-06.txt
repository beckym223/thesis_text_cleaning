8 Satisfactory information on the saving function is virtually impossible to obtain because
the relation of consumption to income payments has been affected in recent years by  changes in taxes and other conditions. These changes may or may not be permanent. Further
changes appear to be ahead. At any rate, they indicate that attempts to deduce the saving
function from time series are likely to have little significance for the future. Such in-
formation as is available indicates that in the range between a national income of 60
billion dollars and 80 billion dollars there is an increase of about 40 cents in saving for
one dollar increase in income. Hence, a persistent deficit (or an increase in investment) of
4 billion dollars is necessary to raise the national income by about 10 billion dollars. If
the persistence of the deficit were to produce an unfavorable shift in the investment function
sufficient to cut private investment from 7 billion dollars to 5.25 billion dollars (or 25 per
cent) at a national income of 70 billion dollars, almost half the benefit of the deficit
would be lost. A shift of even greater magnitude in the investment function might easily
be produced by expectations of higher taxes. During the last decade deficits have been
working most of the time against a sharply declining marginal propensity to spend or
invest additional income, as the drop in the velocity of bank deposits outside New York
from 28.0 in 1933 to 22.6 in 1939 and 21.6 in 1940 plainly indicates. Of course, the drop
in the marginal propensity to spend must be attributed to a variety of causes, but one of

in the face of a substantial rise in the national income and of large in-
creases in taxes. Deficit financing is too new to be well understood. We
are still in the stage of trying to find out why the course of events does
not correspond to the theoretical models. Nevertheless, it is possible to
see why deficit financing at the best is an unreliable device and why it
may do little good and may even impede an expansion of privately pro-
duced income. Since the saving function is considerably more elastic
relative to national income than the investment function, a relatively
large deficit is necessary to raise the national income by a small amount.
But a deficit may cause the investment function to shift to the left,
especially if it arouses the expectation of higher taxes and if the govern-
ment has manifested a strong propensity to tax profits. In this event, all
or nearly all of the stimulus of the deficit may be canceled.8 When
but more so in the second recovery than in the first. The following are the indexes of
wholesale prices of raw materials and finished goods:

A comparison of 1926 and 1937 is of interest. Output per man-hour in manufacturing in
1937 was apparently 33.2 per cent above 1926, hourly earnings 22.4 per cent above 1926.
Finished goods were slightly higher relative to raw materials than in 1926. Nevertheless,
non-financial corporations made profits of only 3.8 billion dollars on sales of 108.4 billion
dollars in 1937, as against profits of 5.8 billion dollars on sales of 106.2 billion dollars in
1926-a margin of 3.54 cents per dollar of sales in 1937 and of 5.44 cents in 1926.

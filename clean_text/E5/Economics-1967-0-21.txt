literature will have to be amended. Managerial discretion will be a
function, not of the independence of the management from the control
of the owners, but chiefly of the independence of the management from
urgent worries about the sufficiency of earnings. If one insists, one
may still say that all managers are primiarly interested in their own
incomes. But, since it is clear that their long-term incomes are jeopar-
dized if profits go below the acceptable rate of return, maximization of
managerial incomes and maximization of profits come to to the same
thing if competition is effective.9
There can be no doubt about the fact that competition is not effec-
tive in many industries and that many, very many, firms are not exposed
to vigorous competition. It follows that managerial discretion can have
its way in a large enough number of firms to secure wide applicability
of well-designed managerial-discretion models-or to invite the use of
managerial total-utility models.
I was fully aware, when I wrote my 1946 article, that there were
many qualifications and exceptions to the principle of profit maximiza-
tion.'0 But I considered it hopeless for predictive purposes to work
with total-utility maximization and I did not see the possibility of com-
bining a few selected managerial goals with the profit motive.
Marginalism Extended: Total Utility
In order to show how hopeless it is to construct a comprehensive
total-utility model and obtain from it definite predictions of the effects
of changes in conditions upon the dispositions of the managers, one
merely has to visualize the large variety of possible "satisfactions" and
the still larger variety of things that may contribute to their attain-

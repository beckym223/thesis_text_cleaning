d The definitions of terms in the studies for the separate Australian states were substantially  similar to those in the four Commonwealth studies, except that (1) working proprietors were  included in the definition of labor; (2) the estimated value of land was deducted fromn the capi-
tal figures; (3) deductions were made from the value of product for (a) the estimated cost of
local and state and federal taxes, (b) estimated fire insurance and workmen's compensation
premiums, and (c) allowances for depreciation upon buildings, plant, and machinery. These
were also the methods used in the Commonwealth Study of 1934-35. See Gunn and Douglas,

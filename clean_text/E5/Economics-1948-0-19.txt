for this article had been prepared, Keith Campbell and George
Brinegar, in their Queensland study for 1937-38, found k to have a
value of .58 and j one of .45.19
Since the sum of the exponents tends to be sliglhtly less than unity,
there is an added slight suggestion of true diminishing returns. But
here again, since the difference is less than the standard errors of
estimate, we should be chary about drawing definite conclusions.
If we choose .60 as the most probable "normal" value of k and .37
as the corresponding value of j, this would mean that the approximate
elasticity of the marginal productivity curve in Australia for labor
was somewhere around 2.7 and for capital of about 1.7.
The third set of results which we should consider are those for New
Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. These are shown in Table III.
Using the formula of k and 1-k, Max Brown found for New Zealand a
value of .51 for k for the period 1915-1935,2o and when we reworked
the Brown series with the second formula, we found values of .42 for
k and .49 for j. It is interesting that in the single cross-section study
which has been made for New Zealand, namely, that made by Williams
for 1938-39, k has a value of .46 and j of .51.2Oa In the four Canadian
studies which we made for so-called "normal" years, the k's range
between .43 and .50, with an average of .47, and the j's between .48
and .58, with an average of slightly more than .52. There is a considerable
degree of steadiness in these results, which seem to indicate
an elasticity of the marginal productivity curve for labor in that country
as slightly less than 2.0 for the years studied and of capital as slightly
more than that figure.
One of the most interesting studies which has been made is that by
G. W. G. Browne for South Africa for 1937-38. Taking the seventeen
main groups of industry and treating all labor as homogeneous, Browne

14 "Economic man deals with the 'real world' in all its complexity," says Herbert Simon
[39, p. xxv]. The homo oeconomicus I have encountered in the literature was not such a
perfectionist. Incidentally, even Simon's "economic man," two years before the ambitious
one just quoted, did not have "absolutely complete," but only "impressively clear and
voluminous" knowledge of the "relevant aspects of his environment" [38, p. 99]. My
point is that we ought to distinguish perfect or imperfect knowledge of (a) the entire
environment, (b) the relevant aspects of the entire environment, (c) the relevant changes
in environmental conditions.

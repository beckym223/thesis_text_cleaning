16 First, of course, I am indebted to my chief associate during this period, namely, Grace
Gunn, and after her to Marjorie L. Handsaker, Patricia Ogburn, Martin Bronfenbrenner,
Ernest Olson, and Estelle Mass. But we have also had the faithful aid of numerous research  assistants, computers, and draftsmen, among whom have been Yetta Abend, Helen Butcher,
Julia Elliott Lewis, Oscar Seltzer, K. Sanow, H. Minsky, B. Nimer, William L. Slayton,
Betty Roth, Donna Allen, Mitchell Locks, Y. K. Wong and Margaret Labadie. My col-
league H. G. Lewis has also been most helpful in his criticisms and suggestions, as have
John H. Smith and Colin Clark.

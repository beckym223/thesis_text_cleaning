There is another factor involved. One of the reasons for the lower
rate of growth of the trade of the less developed countries is surely
that practically all of them pursue highly protectionist policies. In my
opinion, they are going in their protectionism far beyond what can pos-
sibly be justified on infant-industry, terms-of-trade, or any other ra-
tional grounds. But whether one accepts this judgment or not, high pro-
tection reduces the volume of trade19 and by the same token increases
the marginal benefit from trade.
As for the terms of trade, the deterioration from the early 1950's is,
of course, regrettable in the sense that the less developed countries
would be better off if in 1960 their terms of trade were the same as in
1950. But we must keep a sense of proportion. The deterioration was
not catastrophic and cannot be compared with what happened in the
1930's. The comparative order of magnitude is indicated by the fact
that while, according to the U.N., from 1950 to 1960 the deterioration
was 9 per cent, Kindleberger found that in 1938 the terms of trade of
industrial Europe with a large part of the underdeveloped world stood
at 149, with 1928 100 [22] [6].20 To convey an idea of the absolute
magnitude of the "burden" or "loss" involved, let me mention that the
U.N. report computes that "had the terms of trade of the less developed
countries been stabilized at their 1950 level the aggregate purchasing
power of their exports in terms of imports in 1960 would have been
greater to the extent of $2.3 billion." This is not a negligible sum, but
compared with the national income of the less developed areas of the

First, if the per capita income differential increases, or if the income
distribution is more unequal for sector B than for sector A, or if both
conditions are present, the rise over time in the relative weight of sector
B causes a marked increase in inequality in the countrywide income
distribution. We have here a demonstration of the effects upon trends
in income inequality of interindustry shifts away from agriculture discussed
above (pp. 7-8).
Second, if the intrasector income distribution is the same for both
sectors, and the widening inequality in the countrywide income distribution
is due only to the increasing per capita income differential in favor
of sector B, such widening is greater when the intrasector income distributions
are characterized by moderate rather than wide inequality.
Thus, if the intrasector distributions are of the E type, the range in the
countrywide distribution widens from 23.7 to 26.3 as proportion of A
drops from 0.8 to 0.2 and as the ratio of per capita income of sector B
to that of sector A changes from 2 to 4 (see line 4, col. 1, and line 14,
col. 7). If the U distributions are used, the range, under identical conditions,
widens only from 36.8 to 37.9 (see line 7, col. 1, and line 17,
col. 7). This difference is revealed more clearly by the change in the
share of the 1st quintile, which bears the brunt of widening inequality:
for the E distribution, the share drops from 10.5 (line 2, col. 1) to 5.9
(line 12, col. 7); for the U distribution, from 3.8 (line 5, col. 1) to 3.1
(line 15, col. 7).
Third, if the per capita income differential between sectors is constant,
but the intrasector distribution of B is more unequal than that of
A, the widening inequality in the countrywide distribution is the
greater, the lower the assumed per capita income differential. Thus for
a differential of 2 to 1, the range widens from 28.3 when the proportion
of A is 0.8 (line 10, col. 1) to 36.0 at the peak when the proportion of
A is 0.5 (line 10, col. 4) and is still 33.8 when the proportion of A drops
to 0.2 (line 10, col. 7). For a per capita income differential of 4 to 1, the
widening of the range at the maximum is only from 44.2 (line 20, col.
1) to 49.8 (line 20, col. 2) and then the range declines to 37.2 (line 20,
col. 7), well below the initial level.
Fourth, the assumptions utilized in the numerical illustration-of a
rise in proportions of total number in section B, of greater inequality
in the distribution within sector B, and of the growing excess of per
capita income in B over that in A-yield a decline in the share of the 1st
quintile that is much more conspicuous than the rise in the share of the
5th quintile. Thus the share of the 1st quintile, with the proportion of A
at 0.8, distribution in B more unequal than in A, and a per capita income
differential of 2 to 1, is 9.3 (line 8, col. 1). As we shift to a proportion
of A of 0.2, and a per capita income differential of 4 to 1, the

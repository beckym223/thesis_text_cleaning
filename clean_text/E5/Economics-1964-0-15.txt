13a William McC. Martin, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, has acknowledged the role of the balance of payments. "I am convinced that our
failure to solve the problem [of the balance of payments] up to now has not only been
damaging to our international relations but has also impeded the achievement of even high
levels of output and resource utilization" (statement before the House Committee on
Banking and Currency, July 22, 1963, Fed. Reserve Bull., Aug. 1963, p. 1062).
Since the slack is small, it cannot be far off the mark to say that the external deficit has
been the major cause of the slowdown.
14 I do not wish to say, of course, that in the absence of a balance-of-payments deficit
there will never again be a recession or a period of slack. For example, if at a higher level
of employment wage-push became stronger and prices started to creep up again, the mone-
tary and financial brakes would sooner or later be applied as they were in the late 1950's
with the same general result. But demand inflation, wage-push, Phillips curves, income
policy, and all that are not the subject of this talk.

'This does not necessarily mean that it is undesirable. There are valid arguments for
protection which theoretically can be applied to customs unions or free trade areas. In the
case of LAFTA, the protectionist effects are, however, so strong that it would be very
difficult to make a rational case for it on, say, infant-industry grounds. It could conceivably
be defended with the help of a theory of the third or fourth best. Let me briefly indicate
what I have in mind. By means of a policy of partly repressed inflation, tight exchange
control, etc. a country can maneuver itself into a position where trade is so sharply contracted
and distorted that even bilateral trade is better than no trade. Similarly, a regional
trade expansion may be better than no expansion at all, althou-h a relaxation of controls
and general expansion of trade would be infinitely better.

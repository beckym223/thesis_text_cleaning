1936 and 1937, when the hourly earnings of factory workers increased by 12 per cent,
were not in the main directly produced by trade unions. In large measure they represented
an unsuccessful effort on the part of employers to stop the-spread of labor unions. As a
matter of fact, the wage increases seem to have stimulated the growth of unions by con-
vincing the men that there was a lot of easy money around which they might get by
organizing. Some employers who gave a wage increase to prevent their men from
organizing had to give a second increase after the men had formed a union.

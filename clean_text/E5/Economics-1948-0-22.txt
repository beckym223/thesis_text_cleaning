It is submitted that the results are, on the whole, corroborative. If
they were purely accidental, as some have charged, they would show
widely varying results. The fact that on the basis of fairly wide studies
there is an appreciable degree of uniformity, and that the sum of the
For Victoria, the value of b was .97 and for New South Wales, 1.02. In all these cases, b  represents the value of the intercept with the functional plane of theoretical product merely
moved up or down by the small difference between the values of b and unity. In the time
series, of course, we are dealing with index numbers which show relative changes, not
absolute values.

B. Under formula (2) (i.e., P = bLkCJ) b deviates in a greater degree from unity because
of the greater degree of freedom given to the exponent for capital. Here the values for
the United States are:

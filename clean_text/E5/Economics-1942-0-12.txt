many nonunion plants will be sensitive to changes in union scales. The
marginal efficiency of capital depends, among other things, upon the
control of management over costs. In the face of large and powerful
labor organizations, will American business possess sufficient control
over costs to maintain a high marginal efficiency of capital? Or will
unions keep investment opportunity limited by promptly converting
any increase in demand for labor into higher wages?22
Many economists believe that bargained changes in costs are bound
to be completely translated into higher prices, so that changes in the
general wage level produce solely price effects and not output or employment
effects. The relationship between bargained changes in costs
and prices is undoubtedly the most important issue in the theory of
employment. The conclusion that rises in costs are translated into
higher prices so that the return on investments is not affected presupposes,
among other things, a self-contained economy. But even in a selfcontained
economy, the assumed relationship between costs and prices
requires a theory of liquidity preference which is not convincing. It is
assumed that higher wages reduce liquidity preference and that the
shift in the schedule of liquidity preference so increases the volume of
active deposits that prices rise in proportion to the advance in wages.
All of this amounts to assuming that the volume of deposits held idle
is a residual and that it is independent of the purchasing power of the
idle deposits.2" These assumptions are far from realistic. If general
increases in the wage level cannot be counted on to produce offsetting
increases in expenditures and prices, a rise in labor's bargaining power
will tend to reduce the marginal efficiency of capital.24 The resulting

22In other words, will unions prevent any expansion of demand from producing more
employment by causing it to produce higher wages?
23 Suppose that the first reaction of managements to a rise in costs were to advance prices
in proportion. To sustain the higher price level the public would have to be willing to
hold a smaller amount of real purchasing power in cash. It is not clear why a rise in prices
should produce this result, except as higher prices reduce the purchasing power of incomes.
This might produce some tendency to reduce idle deposits. But the drop in the purchasing
power of money would also limit the decrease in idle deposits since the quantity of money
which people desire to hold idle is presumably affected by its purchasing power. Equilibrium
would eventually be reached at some point below the original volume of output and
employment, but with money expenditures somewhat above the original level. In the
above analysis, it is assumed that the demand for assets in the form of idle deposits is such
that idle deposits drop as the purchasing power of money drops. It is possible, however,
that a drop in the purchasing power of money will cause an increase in the number of dollars
held idle. In that event an effort to pass on an increase in costs in the form of higher
prices would produce an even greater drop in output and employment.
24 It is conceivable that wages might get so low and that such a large proportion of the
national income might go to savings and such a small part to labor that further reductions
in wages would cause more than a proportionate drop in total expenditures. As the
increase in investment-seeking funds produced a drop in the marginal return on invest-
ments, the proportion of money held idle would increase. Eventually it would increase so
rapidly as more than to offset the effect of the drop in costs and prices upon the physical

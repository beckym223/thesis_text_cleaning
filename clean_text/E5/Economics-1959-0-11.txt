'Census figures show a slight increase in concentration betwe-n 1947 and 1954 for
industries producing specialized products [23], and that in 1954 the country's 200
largest companies accounted for 37 per cent of the total value added by manufacture
as against 30 per cent in 1947 [25, p. 11]. Adelman, who in his 1951 study [1] was
severely critical of the measurements of industrial concentration employed by the Federal
Trade Commission, defends the Census statistics as "a valuable addition to our stock
of basic information" and "sound in concept"; but he misreads them as showing that
"Concentration did not increase from 1947 to 1954" [2].

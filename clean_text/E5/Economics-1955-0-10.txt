distribution for the rural population is somewhat narrower than in
that for the urban population-even when based on annual income; and
this difference would probably be wider for distributions by secular
income levels.4 Operating with this simple model, what conclusions do
we reach? First, all other conditions being equal, the increasing weight
of urban population means an increasing share for the more unequal of
the two component distributions. Second, the relative difference in per
capita income between the rural and urban populations does not
necessarily drift downward in the process of economic growth: indeed,
there is some evidence to suggest that it is stable at best, and tends to
widen because per capita productivity in urban pursuits increases more
rapidly than in agriculture. If this is so, inequality in the total in-
come distribution should increase.
Two questions then arise: First, why does the share of the top-
income groups show no rise over time if the concentration of savings
has a cumulative effect? Second, why does income inequality decline
and particularly why does the share of the lower-income groups rise if
both the weight of the more unequal urban income distribution and the
relative difference between per capita urban and per capita rural in-
comes increase?
The first question has been discussed elsewhere, although the re-
sults are still preliminary hypotheses,5 and it would be impossible to
do more here than summarize them briefly.

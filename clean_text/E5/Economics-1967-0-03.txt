Last year, when it was my task to plan the program for the annual
meeting of our association, a friend suggested that, with twenty years
having passed since the outbreak of the "marginalism controversy," it
was appropriate to review what has since happened to the embattled
theory of the firm. The topic did not fit the general theme I had chosen
for the 1965 meeting, but I reasoned that 1966 would give me a good
opportunity to undertake the review myself.

The Battlefield Revisited

So let us recall that literary feud and the warriors, and let us revisit
the battlefield. The major battlefield was the American Economic Review,
with six articles and communications between March 1946 and
March 1947 [16] [43] [21] [17] [22] [44]. There had been earlier
gunfire elsewhere, chiefly in the Oxford Economic Papers in 1939 [14].
But, since the shooting then was not returned and it takes at least two
opponents to join battle, it must be agreed that the real hostilities were
the exchanges in the AER.

The fight was spirited, even fierce. Thousands of students of economics,
voluntary or involuntary readers, have been either shocked or
entertained by the violence of some of the blows exchanged and may
have thought that the opponents must have become mortal enemies
forever. These readers would have been wrong. Even before we came
out for the last round of the fight, we exchanged friendly letters (December
1:946) assuring each other that we would bear no grudges.
We have remained the best of friends; for several years now Richard
Lester and I have been colleagues in the same department; and, as
a token of our friendship, he has generously accepted my invitation to
share this platform with me today as chairman of the session. Thus the
veterans of both sides of the War of 1946 are now joined in revisiting

"descriptively false." In view of this sentimental hankering for real-
ism, it may be helpful to survey some of the inclusions which various
writers have proposed in order to meet the demands for greater realism
in the "theory of the firm," and to examine their relevance to the theo-
ry of competitive price. The following considerations are supposed to
supplement, qualify, restrict, or replace the objective of maximizing
money profits.
(1) Entrepreneurs and managers cannot be expected to have an in-
elastic demand for leisure; indeed, one must assume that this demand
is income-elastic so that higher profit expectations will cause them to
sacrifice some income for the sake of more leisure [36, p. 356].
(2) Managers are anxious to avoid resentment on the part of their col-
leagues and subordinates and will, therefore, not enforce their orders
with the sternness required for maximization of profits; similarly,
minor functionaries do not want to disturb the routines of their superi-
ors and, hence, they often abstain from suggesting improvements
which would maximize profits [31, p. 452]. (3) Managers are more
interested in their own salaries, bonuses, and other emoluments, than
in the profits of the firm or the income of its owners [27, pp.
226-27]. (4) The realization of certain asset preferences (for exam-
ple, liquidity as against inventories and fixed assets) may be in conflict
with profit maximization [5, p. 99]. (5) The flow and biased screen-
ing of information through the various levels of management may
cause systematic misinformation resulting in earnings far below the
maximum obtainable [27, p. 229]. (6) The objective of maintaining
control in the hands of the present control group may require a
sacrifice of profit opportunities [31, p. 455]. (7) The preference for
security may be so strong that even relatively conservative ways of
making higher profits are eschewed [12, pp. 270-71]. (8) The striv-
ing for status, power, and prestige may be such that it results in con-
duct not consistent with a maximum of profit [1, p. 145] [28, p.
207] [13, p. xii] [27, p. 227]. (9) The wish to serve society, be a
benefactor, or soothe one's social conscience, may militate against ac-
tions or policies that would maximize profits [7, pp. 16-17] [13, pp.
339-40]. (10) The instinct of workmanship [46, p. 187], a desire to
show professional excellence [1, p. 146], a pervasive interest in feats
of engineering, may lead to performance in conflict with highest possi-
ble profits. (11) Compromises among the different goals of executives
with different interests-production, sales, personnel relations, finance,
research and development, public relations, etc.-are sure to "compro-
mise" the objective of maximum profits [10, p. 29]. (12) A variety
of influences may be exerted on management decisions, perhaps pulling
in different directions and possibly away from maximum profits, as for
example influences from labor organizations, suppliers of materials,

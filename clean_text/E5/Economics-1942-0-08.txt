was greatly increasing the difficulty of adding to one's capital by
successful ventures and at the same time was severely limiting the possibility
of charging unsuccessful ventures against successful ones. Can

venturesome commitments?

What of the long-range outlook? If to shifts in economic and political
power, which have already created difficult problems, is added a narrowed
opportunity for extensive investment, does not the problem of
providing employment become so formidable as to require great changes
in policies and institutions?

One may assert with reasonable confidence, I think, that the consumption
function will slowly become more favorable to employment.
For more than a generation the propensity to consume has been rising
just about fast enough to prevent the increase in per capita incomes
from causing a drop in the proportion of the national income currently

22.8 per cent." In the post-war world, the propensity to consume will
be higher than in the twenties. Corporations will be hampered, as they
have been for nearly a decade, in devoting part of their income to capital

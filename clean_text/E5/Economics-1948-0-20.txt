^ Dr. Max Brown, in his study, The Relation Between Capital and Labour in New Zealand
(an unpublished doctoral dissertation at Cambridge University), defined Product (P) as the
total money value of production divided by the price index of locally produced goods. His
index of Labor (L) was one of total man-hours worked, i.e., numbers employed multiplied by
the length of the standard working week plus or minus the hours of overtime worked or short
time suffered in the various years. The index of Capital (C) was the value of buildings, plant,
and machinery (i.e., fixed capital) with the annual increments of investment deflated by a  price index of the cost of capital goods. We have fitted the function P=bLkCi to the Brown
data as well as the P=bLkCl-k formula which Brown originaily used.  b Professor Williams computed his indexes as follows: (1) Product (P) = (a) value added by
manufacturing (i.e., gross value minus cost of materials, fuel, and power), divided by (b) the
price index of locally produced goods; (2) Capital (C) =initial value (1919-20) of land, buildings,
machinery, and plant minus depreciation actually written off each year, and plus the
money value of additions to capital in each year adjusted for changes in the index, number of
prices for buildings and construction; (3) Labor (L) =number of persons employed. See J. W.
Williams, "Professor Douglas' Production Function," Econ. Record, Vol. XXI (1945), pp.
55-63.
a Professor Browne defined his units as follows: (1) Product (P) =net value added by manu-  facturing or the gross value of output minus cost of materials, fuel, light, and power; (2) Labor
(L) =average number of employees, including wage earners, salaried staff, managers, accountants,
working proprietors, and persons regularly employed in their homes; (3) Capital
(C) =the value of land, buildings, machinery, plant, and tools (i.e., fixed capital only, with
working capital excluded). See G. W. G. Browne, "The Production Function for South African
Manufacturing Industry," South African Jour. Econ., Vol. XI (1943), p. 259.  d This study differed from the former in that it was based on a more minute classification of
industries and that it also separated white and black laborers and treated each as a separate  factor of production. The value of k given is the sum of the k for white labor (.45) and for na-  tive labor (.20). See Browne, op. cit., pp. 260-61. The value of a-k could not be obtained by add-  ing the ok of the exponents for native and white labor.

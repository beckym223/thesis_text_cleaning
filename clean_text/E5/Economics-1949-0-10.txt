4 The contrary opinion that is sometimes met with is to be attributed to the simplified
versions of the marginal-productivity theory that survive in textbooks and do not take
into account all the restrictions to which production functions are subject in real life,
especially if they are production functions of going concerns for which a number of
technological data are, for the time being, unalterably fixed-just as in elementary
mechanics no account is taken of the complications that arise so soon as we drop the
simplifying assumption that the masses of bodies are concentrated in a single point. But
a marginal-productivity theory that does take account of restrictions which, even in
pure competition, prevent factors from being paid according to their marginal productivities
is still marginal-productivity theory.

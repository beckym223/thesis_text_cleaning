ments in the 1950 to 1955 years are of high significance and are there-
fore shown in detail in the chart. Does the direction of the changes since
1951 portend the next decade or so, or is it merely a short-run adjust-
ment to a normal level which will be reached presently?
It should also be pointed out at this stage that the absolute level of
agriculture's share in GNP is not quite as low as the figures in the tables

and charts indicate, because the farm-produced farm products consumed
by the farm family and the use of the farm dwellings are valued at the
farm and not at what the farm family would have to pay for them in the
city. Any accurate comparison of farm and nonfarm output must put
both on the same basis. In a dominantly urban country, this had better
be urban rather than farm value. There is also the consumption use of
the farm automobile charged off partly as an expense in figuring GNP.
If rectification is made for these three items, the 7.4 per cent of GNP
in Table III becomes something like 8.4.
II. Projection to 1975 and Beyond
Land Use
In the end we shall want to project the agriculture of the United
States in 1975 and beyond in terms of labor force, productive assets,
and gross national product just as we have in 1950-55 and before. But

process of continual development, in response to social pressures
resulting from practical maladjustments of all sorts, is both necessary
and unavoidable; and with the intensification of public consciousness
as to desirable ends and appropriate means, more positive objectives
are constantly emerging and being implemented-the powers and opportunities
which inhere in our political democracy are being utilized
not only to advance special interests, but to further the deliberate
attainment of more general economic well-being.
The labors of economists would proceed on an unrealistic basis, and
would tend to be sterile in many respects, if adequate heed were not
given to the legal environment in which economic enterprise is organized
and economic forces operate; but it is even more important that the
controlling system of law should reflect adequately the economic environment
in which its rules and standards and policies are applicable.
If law is to serve as a living instrument for the guidance of human
relationships in the economic sphere, it must necessarily embrace a
process of reasonable adjustment to social change; and, in point of fact,
the relative stability of our institutions is attributable in large measure
to the actual recognition of this principle of growth in our legal system.
Despite the existence at times of significant conflicts between law and
economics, involving especially undue lags in the development of constitutional
doctrine, even the large mass of common-law rules has been
fashioned progressively, though slowly, to accord with the demands of
our dynamic society; and the major measures of economic policy which
find expression in legislation and administration have come to constitute
an integral part of the prevailing body of law. By and large, at least as
of the present, the growth of our legal system is not being artificially or
unduly restricted by the individualistic traditions which surrounded the
early development of modern industrialism.

Both prevailing and proposed economic policies must be judged on
their merits, in light of all conditioning circumstances; and on this
basis economists have much to contribute toward the development of
sound and effective policy measures. The immediate sensitiveness of
economic conduct to indirect and remote influences, as well as the
long-run economic consequences of controls, must of necessity receive
informed consideration; and reasoned emphasis upon the broader
implications of economic policy, in their bearing upon our entire
institutional setup, also possesses a large measure of persuasive pertinence.
In other words, we must not permit ourselves to, drift into an
essentially collectivistic economy. But when opposition to policy
measures is voiced in extreme terms-when virtually all significant

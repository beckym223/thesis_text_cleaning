It merely presupposes that the 'rational-economic'  portion of business conduct is by and large sufficiently important to affect what is going  on in the world to an extent large enough to warrant analysis; and that the substitution  of money profits for a composite of pecuniary and nonpecuniary rewards simplifies the  analysis so much that the gain in expediency far exceeds the loss in applicability" [23  pp. 30-31]. A similar view is expressed by Scitovsky: "Empirical studies of businessmen's  behavior suggest the need for modifying or qualifying the assumption of profit maximiza-  tion here and there, rather than scrapping it altogether. Accordingly, . . . we shall retain  the assumption that the firm aims at maximizing its profit. But we shall regard this  assumption as a working hypothesis rather than as a universal rule" [37, p. 111].

volume of transactions. Hence two zones might be distinguished: one in which expenditures
change proportionately less than changes in wages and in which wage increases are
unfavorable to employment; and one in which expenditures change proportionately more
than changes in wages and in which wage increases are favorable to employment. In the
former zone, the usual one, the effect of wage changes on the investment function would not
be offset by their effect upon the savings function; in the latter zone, the effect of
wage changes upon the investment function would be offset by their effect on the
savings function. The latter zone would appear to be an unstable one because wage
increases, by reducing unemployment, would produce more wage increases and because
wage cuts, by producing more unemployment, would produce more wage cuts. As a
matter of fact, wages in relation to prices apparently never get down into the zone of
instability.
5 Such a period of shifting creates great uncertainty over the future of costs. In the
face of such uncertainty managers may be more reluctant to make long-term commitments
than they would be after unions are better established and stronger but when economic

differences appear between the results for the earliest year of 1889
and the years from 1904 on. From 1904 on, and particularly in 1914
and 1919, the big deviations were predominantly on the plus, and the
minor deviations on the minus, side. Thus, in 1919, of the 18 industries
where the deviations amounted to more than two standard errors of


estimate, 16 had their actual products in excess of the theoretical
values, while in only two cases did they fall below. On the other hand,
of the 538 industries in 1919 where the deviations amounted to less
than two standard errors, 308 or nearly three-fifths, were below what
would have been expected under the formula. For the three census years
of 1909, 1914, and 1919, there were 29 industry observations where
the actual products were more than two standard errors of estimate
greater than the theoretical values and only 10 industry observations
which were more than two standard errors less. Conversely, in these
three years there were only 504 industries which had actual products
which exceeded the theoretical values up to two standard errors as
contrasted with 613 industries where the actual products fell below
the theoretical by these amounts.

The general framework of these later results is approximately what
we would expect on theoretical grounds. The monopolistic and expanding
industries tend to absorb large quantities of purchasing power at
the expense of the rest of the economy. They would, therefore, be
expected to show wider profit margins than the general average and
each combined dose of labor and capital would consequently tend to
yield a greater dollar value than would normally be the case. The withdrawal
of this purchasing power would, moreover, exert a slight depressing
influence upon each of the remaining industries so that we

the theoretical values is, therefore, somewhat closer than what we
would normally expect on the basis of random errors of sampling and
of measurement. Belief in the reliability of the formula as a description
of production during this period is, therefore, strengthened, rather
than weakened.


Let us see from Table VI if these results are confirmed by an analysis
of the deviations of the actual from the theoretical values in the thirteen
cross-section studies which we have thus far made for the Dominions
within the British Commonwealth of Nations. It will be noticed that
out of the total of 1373 observations, 1025, or over 74 per cent deviated
by less than one standard error of estimate from the theoretical values,

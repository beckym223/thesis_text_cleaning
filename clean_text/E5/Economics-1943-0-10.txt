' In this section I have employed the expression "common good" to describe the
objective envisaged by legislators and government officials at their best, whereas throughout
the paper I use common interest to describe the objective of voluntary collective bargaining.
Concepts of the common good distort or complicate strictly economic considerations by the
intrusion of ethical or aesthetic preconceptions of the official or other person using the
term. "Interest" connotes synthetic objectification similar to that embodied in the
concept of market demand. There is a common interest in high total productivity if only
we can discover means of allowing it to come to expression.

23 W. Arthur Lewis has reached similar conclusions in two important papers [9] [10].
Speaking of Latin America, he said: "Puzzling are those cries which seem to be founded on
the belief that it is particularly difficult to expand exports because the world is buying
fewer and fewer exports. The opposite is true. World trade has never grown faster. Between
1950 and 1960 the quantum of world trade in primary products increased at an average
rate of 6 per cent per annum, and the quantum of world trade in manufacturers by more
than 7 per cent per annum. The terms of trade for primary products could not retain the
heights to which they were raised by the speculative fever of the Korean War and the heavy
American stockpiling in the early fifties; nevertheless the average terms of trade for the
decade of the nineteen-fifties were better than for any previous decade in all the preceding
hundred years. I do not know whether it is in fact true that in the 1950's, Latin America
had difficulty in keeping her exports growing at the same rate as national income but if
this was so, it cannot possibly have been due to failure of world demand to grow adequately,
since the quantum of world trade was growing by about 7 per cent per annum  throughout the 1950's. Taking the continent as a whole, rather than individual countries,
failure on this score can only have been a failure of effort" [10, pp. 10-11].

for their exports, and a sharp deterioration of their terms of trade comparable
to what happened in the 1930's is virtually excluded.
I should add that this fairly optimistic appraisal relates only to the
international trade position of the less developed countries.23 Far be it
from me to belittle the severe handicaps from which many less developed
countries suffer, such as poor natural resources and bad climate,
population pressure, political and social instability, and, I am
afraid one has to add, exceedingly bad economic policies. All I have
said was that a shrinking or stagnant world market has not been among
the handicaps since the war.

VII'. Outlook for the Future

Instead of summarizing what I have said, let me try to peer a little
into the future. Since economists are not endowed with the gift of
prophecy, I shall not try to predict what will happen to world trade in
the future but do the next best thing and suggest what would be the
course of events if certain conditions are fulfilled.
I see no reason why the the growth of world trade and the ever closer
integration of the major areas of the world should not continue if two
conditions are met. The first, basic requirement is maintenance of a
high level of employment and growth in the industrial countries. On
this nothing more need be added, except to say that to me the chances
look good that this condition will be fulfilled. But it is a necessary, not
a sufficient, condition. At least in the larger countries economic activity
could grow quite satisfactorily (although not at the highest attainable
speed) without a corresponding growth of trade.

The second presupposition is further liberalization of trade or, as a
minimum, avoidance of increases in trade barriers for balance-of-payments
or protectionist reasons. I am afraid we cannot be so sure about
this condition being met as about the first. Balance-of-payments

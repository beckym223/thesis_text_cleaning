rise in the national income (21.1 billion dollars) to a level of 71.4 billion
dollars produced a gain of 3 billion dollars in profits. When profits come
hard, the disposition to venture is weak.
The lesser success of enterprises in converting a rise of business into
profits after 1933 than after 1921 is explained by a variety of circumstances,
but very largely by the movements of labor efficiency and
wages. Physical productivity per man-hour grew twice as fast after 1921
as after 1933 or 1934, but wage rates went up twice as rapidly in the
second period as in the first. These differences were not entirely compensated
by price movements.7

During the period when shifts in economic power and public policy
substantially reduced the attractiveness of long-range plans, government
fiscal policy was developing in ways that greatly reduced the marginal
efficiency of capital and especially diminished the attractiveness of ventures
involving considerable uncertainty and risk. To begin with, a large
deficit in the regular budget persisted undiminished, except for one year,
"Between 1921 and 1923, man-hour productivity in manufacturing increased 3.06 per
cent per year as against 2.0 per cent between 1934 and 1937. In mineral industries it
increased 7.1 per cent a year in the first period and 5.0 per cent in the second; in
railroading, 4.3 per cent in the first period, and 3.8 per cent in the second. (S. Bell,
Productivity, Wages, and National Income, pp. 269, 27 1, 274.) Hourly earnings in
manufacturing increased 3.2 per cent between 1921 and 1923, according to the
National Industrial Conference Board. Between 1934 and 1937, hourly earnings in
manufacturing increased 15.7 per cent according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
and 19.6 per cent according to the National Industrial Conference Board.
In some respects it is more satisfactory to compare the period 1921 to 1926 with the
period 1933 to 1937. In the first period man-hour productivity in manufacturing increased
4.3 per cent a year as against 1.7 per cent in the second; in the mineral industries, it
increased 8.0 per cent a year in the first period and 3.7 per cent in the second; in
railroading, it increased 3.3 per cent per year in the first period and 3.0 per cent in
the second. Between 1921 and 1926, hourly earnings in manufactuiring rose 8.4 per cent;
between 1933 and 1937, 40 per cent.
In the case of electric light and power, productivity per man-hour apparently increased
more rapidly following 1933 than following 1921-6.9 per cent a year between 1933 and
1937, instead of 2.8 per cent a year as between 1921 and 1926. The actual difference was
probably considerably less than the figures indicate because there was much more
construction in the industry in 1926 than in 1937. Some of the construction is done by
outside contractors whose employees are not counted as in the industry. Much of it,
however, is done by employees of the utilities. As the construction is not counted as
part of the product of the industry, the use of employees of the industry tends to reduce
the output per man-hour. The changing proportion of employees working on non-current
operations (together with the changing proportion engaged on maintenance and repairs
as maintenance is now postponed and then accelerated) makes all figures on man-hour
productivity more or less unreliable. In the case of comparisons between 1921-26 on
the one hand, and 1933-37 on the other, the changes in construction and in maintenance
policy probably cause the difference in increase in efficiency to appear to be less than it
really was.

12 Lipsey [11, p. 441 found that as far as the United States is concerned "over the whole
period [1879-1960] the only suggestion of a downward trend in the ratio of the quantity of
trade to output was the low interwar export and postwar import ratios. Both now appear
to have been temporary." Lipsey reached his results by using constant dollar rather than
current value trade figures. The difference between current and deflated dollar value ratios of
trade and output stems from the fact that both export and import prices have fallen in the
long run compared with domestic prices. Hence a different deflator has to be used for the
two iteims of the ratio. If "invisible" exports and imports could be added to merchandise
trade, the statistical support for the theory of the declining trade-GNP ratio would be
further weakened.

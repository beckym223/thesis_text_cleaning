be much more richly endowed with variables and functions for which
information could be obtained only at considerable effort and with results
that may or may not be worth the cost of the required research.
My charge that there is widespread confusion regarding the purposes
of the "theory of the firm" as used in traditional price theory refers
to this: The model of the firm in that theory is not, as so many
writers believe, designed to serve to explain and predict the behavior
of real firms; instead, it is designed to explain and predict changes in
observed prices (quoted, paid, received) as effects of particular
changes in conditions (wage rates, interest rates, import duties, excise
taxes, technology, etc.). In this causal connection the firm is only a
theoretical link, a mental construct helping to explain how one gets
from the cause to the effect.4 This is altogether different from explaining
the behavior of a firm. As the philosopher of science warns,
we ought not to confuse the explanans with the explanandum.
Misplaced Concreteness
To confuse the firm as a theoretical construct with the firm as an
empirical concept, that is, to confuse a heuristic fiction with a real organization
like General Motors or Atlantic & Pacific, is to commit the
"fallacy of misplaced concreteness." This fallacy consists in using theoretic
symbols as though they had a direct, observable, concrete meaning.

In some fields, investigators are protected from committing the fallacy,
at least with regard to some of their problems, by the fact that a
search for any empirical counterpart to the theoretical construct seems
hopeless. Thus, some physicists working on particle theory were able

4The same statement can be made about the household. The "household" in price theory
is not an object of study; it serves only as a theoretical link between changes in prices
and changes in labor services supplied and in consumer goods demanded. The hypothetical
reactions of an imaginary decision-maker on the basis of assumed, internally consistent
preference functions serve as the simplest and heuristically satisfactory explanation of
empirical relationships between changes in prices and changes in quantities. In other words,
the household in price theory is not an object of study.
Behavioral studies of real households are something entirely different. A realistic, behavioral
theory of the household might conceivably distinguish the large, children-dominated
household from a simpler, father-dominated one. The decisions in the childrendominated
household, where mother frequently and father occasionally try to exercise
some influence, are probably not consistent, since different preference systems are made
explicit at various times, with varying decibels and gestures deployed to make them pre-  vail over the preferences of other members of the family.
One can imagine studies on the behavior of particular households selected at random or
in structured samples. If the researcher learns that a spoiled brat in a family wants to
eat nothing but beef and throws a tantrum every time his mother tries to feed him other
kinds of meat, a reduction in the price of chicken will probably not substantially increase
the consumption of chicken in this family. Thus, the weight of the child's taste in the
decision process of the family can explain a low elasticity of its demand for chicken. But
none of this has much bearing on general price theory.

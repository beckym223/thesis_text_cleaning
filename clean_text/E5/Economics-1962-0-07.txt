2If the history of science is still generally in a crude form, that is primarily because  scholars have just recently begun to take it seriously. In the case of mathematics, there is
a most ludicrous ignorance of the true sequence of contributions: if a formula, such as  Lagrange's interpolation formula, is attributed by name to a person, the betting is good
that small research will show it appeared in earlier writinrgs. What I have in mind here
is not the statement that there is nothing new under the sun and all knowledge is a
repetition of previously known knowledge: on the contrary, such a statement is the
reverse of the truth; mathematical knowledge has been cumulative and, with enough  research and luck. we might hope to clean up the false history of the subject. The situa-  tion in mathematics is especially simple if one takes the view that the objects of mathe-  matical research are theorems and that most importance attaches to the date of their first  rigorous proof. Thus, it is meaningful to say that the "strong ergodic theorem" goes back
to G. D. Birkhoff in 1931, and that J. v. Neumann deserves the credit for two-person  zero-sum game theory. (But if one is also interested in conjecture, heuristics and partial
insight, the matter is not so simple. Some modern mathematicians, one feels, will rename  Fermat's Last Theorem to Schwartz's Theorem if the first man to prove it happens to be
named Schwartz.) In economics, datings are harder: thus I cannot tell you who first
disproved "the labor theory of value," much less who originated it.

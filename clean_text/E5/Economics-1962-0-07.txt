writing in 1838, had an analytical power and freshness that is breath-
taking? But who in his right mind could argue that Cournot had been
a great force on the history of ideas: what Paris salon preoccupied
itself with sellers of mineral water? Except through possible indirect
influences of his teachings, Cournot's impact on ideology must surely
have been negligible.
I quite agree. In many ways the history of a subject's technical
analysis is easier to write precisely because it need not involve the
determination of social influencings.2 Tonight we do not want to linger
on analytics, except perhaps to draw the obvious moral that, if econo-
mists spend more and more of their time on highly technical mathe-
matics and statistics, they must not be surprised if the intelligent man
of affairs comes to ignore this part of their activities. It is true that
Voltaire and Madame du Chatelet, his great and good friend, wrote
profusely on Newton's universal law of gravitation; but this really
amounted to vulgarization of that subject, gross vulgarization on the
part of Voltaire and neat vulgarization on the part of that gifted lady.
While we should not minimize the importance of vulgarization-I
mean communication-we must not blink the fact that this is an area
where Gresham's Law operates in its most remorseless fashion: vulgar
vulgarizatioin drives out subtle, just as strong ideology outsells weak.
The split, between "the inside look" of a subject in terms of the
logic and experience of its professional development and its implica-
tions for the mian-in-the-street or the academician down the campus,
is well recognized. No one gets a Nobel Prize for an essay on the re-
lationship of quantum mechanics to free will and God; but one who
has already received such a prize will get a better hearing for his
random or systematic thoughts on the topic. Nor, these days, do you
get appointed to chairs of economics by virtue of your social elo-

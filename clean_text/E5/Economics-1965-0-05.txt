Mill's essay elicited a brilliant attack by Macaulay, who turned MAill's argument that  every man seeks only his own interests against the plea for universal suffrage:
That the property of the rich minority can be made subservient to the pleasures of  the poor majority will scarcely be denied. But Mr. Mill proposes to give the poor  majority power over the rich minority. Is it possible to doubt to what, on his own
principles, such an arrangement must lead?
The argument is carried to an interesting prediction: "As for America, we appeal to the  twentieth century," "Mill's Essay on Government," in Critical, Historical and Miscel-  laneous Essays (New York 1873), II, pp. 36-37, 40.

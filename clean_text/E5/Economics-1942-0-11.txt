As men were thrown out of work in the capital goods industries through failure of  the increase in the working force to create opportunities for extensive investment, the  unemployed would become available for employment in new plants and on new machines  and thus would furnish opportunities for extensive investment. But the idle plant produced  by the contraction of employment would limit the return on new investment and thus  tend to discourage it. Whether or not unemployment produced extensive investment,  therefore, would depend upon the terms on which the unemployed would accept work. They  would need to be willing to accept employment at sufficiently below current rates to  make new investment opportunities attractive despite the existence of idle plant and
machines.

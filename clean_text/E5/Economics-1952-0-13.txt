'2 I pause over this sentence. Possibly it is true, but in business-cycle theorizing so much
(lepends upon selection and emphasis that theories can even be misleading. Recognition of
such defects then induces some other theorist to present a counter-theory, and so the
game goes on endlessly. I have long preferred J. M. Clark's "strategic factors" approach,
based on the data rather than on any system of internal logic.
As the theories pile up one on another, we find ourselves forced to classify (and also
to sift and discard), to the point where this process of classification becomes itself a
form of business-cycle theorizing; the results are almost certain to have stamped upon  them the selection and emphasis which seem most acceptable to the classifier and interpreter.
Such work performs an invaluable service for the graduate students, whose success  in their doctoral examinations turns so much upon the compendiousness of their knowledge
of the literature. (I had wanted to say "conipendiosity," but cannot find it in the
dictionary.)  There is, at the opposite extreme, the all-inclusive type of business-cycle theory (for  which Swan nominates Kaldor's theory) into which almost any particular theory can be  fitted; but this sort of theory is apt to be so generalized as to be merely truistic.

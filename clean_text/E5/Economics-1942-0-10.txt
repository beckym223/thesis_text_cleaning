function in the United Kingdom between the pre-World War
and the post-World War decades, as indicated by Colin Clark's estimates,
did not prevent the persistence of a large amount of unemployment
throughout the twenties.16 Too much attention has been paid by
recent economic theory to mere changes in the amount of thriftiness and
too little to changes in the kind of thriftiness and to shifts in the propensity
to invest.'7

The effect of the drop in the rate of population growth upon investment
opportunity might seem to depend in the main upon how rapidly
the marginal return on capital falls as capital per worker increases.
Except for the investigations of Douglas, little work has been done on
this point. The problem, of course, is not how marginal efficiency of
investment behaves under static conditions but how it behaves under
the rate and kind of technological change and the price movements that
may be expected to occur. It is highly probable (though not inevitable)
that technological change will increase the amount of capital that each
worker can advantageously manage because inventions consist largely
of making apparatus more automatic and adding automatic attachments.
Douglas estimates that an increase of 270 per cent in fixed capital
per worker in manufacturing between 1899 and 1922 was accompanied
by a drop of 44 per cent in the marginal physical productivity
of capital."S This is not a rapid drop and it occurred when technological
research was on a far smaller scale than it is now. It is interesting to
observe that the drop in the marginal physical productivity of capital
was accompanied by a large rise in interest rates.'9 This contrast between
the movement of interest rates and the marginal physical productivity
of capital suggests in how great measure the marginal return

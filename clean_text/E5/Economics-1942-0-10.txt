17 Liquidity preference appears to be sensitive to changes in investment opportunity. An
improvement in the marginal efficiency of capital not only produces more investment under
a given state of liquidity preference but also actually changes the state of liquidity preference;
that is, produces a shift in the schedule of liquidity preference. Likewise, a drop in
the marginal efficiency of capital produces a rise in liquidity preference. Furthermore, a
rise in liquidity preference produces a drop in the marginal efficiency of capital and hence
a further rise in liquidity preference. Because the marginal efficiency of capital and the
schedule of liquidity preference are not independent variables, a change in either one of them
is more important in determining the capacity of the economy to expand than changes
in the consumption function.

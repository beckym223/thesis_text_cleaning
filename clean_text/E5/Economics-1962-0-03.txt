"For there are, ill the present times, two opinions: not, as in former ages the true and the
false; but the outside and the inside."

J. M. Keynes (1921)

"The proper study of Mankind is man." So said the infallible poet.
And past experience at these annual gatherings of the sons and daughters
of Adam Smith suggests that the popular subject of discussion
among economists is not so much economics as economists. Usually the
annual presidential address is an exception-an exception that does
not always improve upon the rule.

According to our annals, an expiring president of this occult body
begins with two choices. He may, on the one hand, give an address
that summarizes his lifework or his basic contribution to some important
field of scholarship. Thus, my old teacher, Paul H. Douglas,
just as he was about to come out of his academic cocoon and emerge
as a senatorial butterfly, gave his 1947 address on the Laws of Production,
summarizing his decades of work measuring statistical production
functions.

I am afraid this choice is not open to me. My own scholarship has
c,overed a great variety of fields. And many of them involve questions
like welfare economics and factor-price equalization; turnpike theorems
and osculating envelopes; nonsubstitutability relations in Minkowski-
Ricardo-Leontief-Metzler matrices of Mosak-Hicks type; or
balanced-budget multipliers under conditions of balanced uncertainty
in locally impacted topological spaces and molar equivalences. My
friends warn me that such topics are suitable merely for captive audiences
in search of a degree-and even then not after dark.
This leaves me still with several possible choices. For one thing, I
can always talk about methodology. But although my children think
of me as a remnant of "the olden days," to myself I seem just recently

'Sweden's Gustav Cassel, whom the public regarded as about the world's leading
economist in the 1920's and who might have become a truly outstanding scholar if his
temperament had been different, is shown by the following story to be a good opposite
to Mill. H. C. Sonne, the distinguished merchant banker and chairman of the National
Planning Association, has told how Cassel visited at Sonne's family home in Denmark in
the days around the First World War. A guest happened to mention that some scholar
had just made a fresh study of the relationship between the price level and gold supply
and had come up with conclusions strongly at variance with the famous Cassel thesis.
When asked what he intended to do about it, Cassel replied as follows. "I have a son-in-
law whom I have put through Divinity School at some considerable expense. Now that
he has graduated and qualified for his diploma, he comes to me and says that he has lost
his faith and asks what to do. My advice to him was simple: 'Just carry on as if nothing
had happened'."
Relevant too is a conversation I had last month in London after I had given the Stamp
Memorial Lecture in the University of London for 1961. In that lecture I discussed,
among other things, some of the problems of economic forecasting and stressed the need
for scientific validation and the desirability of each forecaster's going back ruthlessly to
review ex post his ex ante predictions. "A great mistake," I was told by one of the best
forecasters in English academic life. "It is fatal ever to read what you have earlier
written. It breaks your nerve as a forecaster." His lips were smiling but his eyes looked  serious.

and Mill's forging of the general-equilibriurn concept of demand and
supply schedules, even before the 1838 date of Cournot's definitive
partial-equilibrium formulation, is ignored by all but the true gourmets
of economic theory, who recognize it as an analytical contribution of
the first magnitude.
John Stuart Mill, son of a dogmatic father, was himself eclectic and
had an engaging ability to change his mind when new facts or argu-
ments became available or merely from rethinking old attitudes! It
is almost fatal to be flexible, eclectic, and prolific if you want your
name to go down in the history books: get known for one idea, how-

zero in the stationary state or that land is the source of all value-and
you are sure to get at least a paragraph in the history books for it.
Also, Mill had what Nietzsche once referred to as an offensively clear
style.
Yet so great was Mill as a thinker and reflector that he was able
to overcome these handicaps. His views on liberty will, even in the
post-Freud world, never go out of date and can perhaps be summarized
in the words of Mrs. Pat Campbell, Bernard Shaw's pen-mistress:
People should be allowed to do anything they like-provided only

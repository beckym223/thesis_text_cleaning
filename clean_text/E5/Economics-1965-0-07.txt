to a level where its implications for policy become a matter of logic
rather than a vehicle for expressing personal tastes.'0
Let us leap on to Marshall who brought up the rear of this tradition
as of so many others in English economics. He conceded an expanding
potential role to the state, in the control of monopoly, in the housing of
the poor, and in the treatment of poverty generally. Yet he persevered
in his preference for private enterprise wherever possible. The preference
rested heavily on the belief that bureaucratic management would
be burdensome and inefficient." Marshall at this point wrote the boldest
sentence of his life:
If Governmental control had supplanted that of private enterprise a
hundred years ago [1807], there is good reason to suppose that our methods
of manufacture now would be about as effective as they were fifty
years ago, instead of being perhaps four or even six times as efficient as
they were then.'2
Yet the "good reason" was never presented, although it was more important
to demonstrate this proposition if true than to answer any
other question to which Marshall devoted a chapter or a book or even

reversion to Adam Smith!
So much for a century of laissez faire. The main school of economic
individualism had not produced even a respectable modicum of evidence
that the state was incompetent to deal with detailed economic
problems of any or all sorts. There was precious little evidence, indeed,
that the state was unwise in its economic activities, unless one was pre-

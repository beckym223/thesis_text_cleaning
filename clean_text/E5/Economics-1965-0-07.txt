'0Mill's famous essay, On Liberty, does little to reduce our uncertainty. It is here that
he asserts:
Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided
the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting the ends.
The laws which, in many countries on the Continent, forbid marriage unless the parties
can show that they have the means of supporting a family, do not exceed the
legitimate powers of the State....
As the principle of the individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of Free
Trade . . . (The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill [Modern Library 1939],
pp. 956, 1035, 1024).
It is not easy to avoid the conclusion that for Mill "liberty" was conveniently well correlated
with the forms of behavior of which he personally approved.

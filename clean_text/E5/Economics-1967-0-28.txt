aim. The theory of prices and allocation, viewed as a theory of
adjustment to change, does not call for impossible performances."5 I
ask you to remember what I spelled out, twenty years ago, about the
difference between exact estimates and calculations, on the one hand,
and "sizing up" in nonnumerical terms, on the other [21, pp. 524-25,
534-35]. And I ask you to realize how many more good predictions
can be made on the basis of the assumption that firms try to maximize
their profits than on the basis of the assumption that they want no
more than satisfactory profits. Take one illustration: if an easy-money
policy is introduced, we expect that some firms will increase their borrowings,
some firms will increase their purchases, some firms will sell
at higher prices, and some firms will increase their output. But if everybody
was satisfied before the change, we cannot infer any of these
things. On the other hand, if we assume that firms prefer a larger
profit to a smaller one, all the mentioned consequences follow from the
simple model.
The Twenty-one Concepts of the Firm
Several times in this paper I have spoken of the fallacy of misplaced
concreteness, committed by mistaking a thought-object for an object
of sense perception, that is, for anything in the real, empirical world.
My warnings might have given rise to another confusion, namely, that
there are only two concepts of the firm. There are many more, and I
do not wish to suppress altogether my strong taxonomic propensities. I
shall offer a list of ten different contexts calling for even more different
concepts, some theoretical, some more empirical.
One of my favorite philosophers, who was a past-master of the art
of making fine distinctions, enumerated 13 concepts of "pragmatism"
[18], 66 concepts of "nature" [19, pp. 447-56], and "a great
number" of concepts of "God."'6 I am sure there are at least 21 concepts
of the firm employed in the literature of business and economics,

theory of the profit-maximizing firm will without hesitation tell us that imports will de-
cline. What will the theory of the satisficing firm tell us? "Models of satisficing behavior
are richer than models of maximizing behavior, because they treat not only of equilibrium
but of the method of reaching it as well. Psychological studies of the formation and change
of aspiration levels support propositions of the following kinds. (a) When performance
falls short of the level of aspiration, search behavior (particularly search for new alter-
natives of action) is induced. (b) At the same time, the level of aspiration begins to ad-
just itself downward until goals reach levels that are practically attainable. (c) If the
two mechanisms just listed operate too slowly to adapt aspirations to performance, emo-
tional behavior-apathy or aggression, for example-will replace rational adaptive be-
havior" [40, p. 263]. I admit that this is an unfair use of the theory of satisficing, but
I wanted to show that everything has its place and no theory can be suitable to all
problems. I suspect, however, that Simon's theory of satisficing behavior will yield neither
qu1antitaftive nor qualitative predictions.  "0Lovejoy Denied Approval by Sen-ate Group," The Baltimore Sun, April 1, 1951.

1939, a definite standard of 90 to 904 per cent of parity for the basic
commodities had been established, and in 1942, provision was duly
made for supporting these prices at this level for two years after the
war was declared to be officially ended. As for agricultural legislation
since the war, suffice to say at this point that even though the last Congress
did not succumb to strong pressures to re-establish a rigid full
parity standard, still the belief is strong among a good majority of
farmers that agriculture does not receive its proportional share of the
national income, and very many of those so believing stand ready to
have the government take pretty arbitrary measures to help them get
this proportional share.
Income Shares-Secular Changes
T
hese comparisons over time say in effect that over the whole period
since 1910, the decline of agriculture's share of income and of GNP
have closely matched those of population and labor force, but that the
decline in agriculture's share of NNP has been somewhat greater,
probably because of the capital costs involved in the relatively larger
share in productive assets. For the years since 1940, however, agriculture'
s share of income, GNP and NNP, have declined much less than
of population and labor force, probably partly because of the increase
in share of productive assets. For only the years since 1951, however,
the income and product shares have declined more than those of
labor and the other input factors.
Much the same story is told by Chart III, appearing in the new 1956
Outlook Chartbook of the Department of Agriculture, in which Farm
Income and National Income are plotted as index numbers with the
high incomes of 1947-49 as the base equal to 100. All the way from
1921 to 1949 the two income series run roughly together even though
agriculture's share of the labor force was declining from 27 to around
12 per cent. What this chart really shows is that somehow or other from

'Keynes, op. cit., pp. 297-98.
I have never been sure how much he really meant this passage (though surely he did
when he wrote it) and how much, perhaps unconsciously, he felt the need of taking the
curse off his own essentially similar kind of presentation. He, probably more than anyone
else, provided the impetus for the mathematical model-building which has become a
kind of economists' refuge since the General Theory appeared. As one of my younger
mathematical friends once said to me: "I don't know whether Keynes' system is right
or not, but it is a beautiful thing to play with."
It was, I think, in connection with this sort of interest and technique that the word
'elegance" came into economics.

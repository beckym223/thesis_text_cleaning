'This point of view represents a significant contrast with Adam Smith's and suggests
how far current thinking on economic matters has been affected by institutional arrangements.
Smith said, "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the
baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address
ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our
own necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chuses to depend chiefly
upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens" [26, p. 14].

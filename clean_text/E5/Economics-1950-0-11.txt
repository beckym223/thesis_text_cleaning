"social security" measures; but these measures should supplement and
not supplant individual self-reliance. Amongst the several major variables
which combine to produce downturns in economic activity or to
protract depression, we can surely select more promising channels of
public policy than influencing saving. In the first place, even the proponents
of the over-saving thesis regard the growth of capital equipment
as an earmark of economic progress; and hence consistency would
demand primary emphasis upon inducing private investment sufficient
to absorb savings, or supplementing this with public investment if need
be-but in no event limiting saving. Secondly, saving rests upon ingrained
habit or long-standing business mores and cannot readily be
adjusted to short-term variations. But thirdly, when alternatives exist
which do not abridge individual choice, and when their effectiveness is
not less, they are clearly preferable.

Monetary and fiscal policies to stablize economic activity are actually
more effective because they operate quickly; and they do not abridge
individual choice in the direct and objectionable fashion of policies to
limit saving. Monetary policy consists directly of influencing the quantity
of money and hence indirectly the rate of spending. Fiscal policy
consists directly of influencing the rate of spending through the powerful
government sector, and indirectly the quantity of money. Individual
economic choice does not, except in a minor way and need not at all, influence
the quantity of money; and individual economic choice does not
determine government revenue and expenditure. Hence, in policies to
achieve economic stability through Federal Reserve and Treasury operations,
we are not significantly abridging the choices which the economic
agents-individuals, businesses, state and local governmentsregard
as matters for their own disposition. Economic activity under
private enterprise in a progressive economy is not self-stabilizing and it
requires political decisions to bring about an even evolution. But
amongst eligible alternatives there is no apology for making the political
decision gratuitously abridge individual free choice. The "optimum
propensity to save" does precisely this.

The fourth optimum to be considered is the notion of an "optimum
rate of (foreign) exchange," first promulgated, so far as I know, by Mrs.
Robinson.6 The idea is advanced rather incidentally and I do not propose
to give it more than illustrative significance. Furthermore, this rate,
defined as the one which-wage rates and other underlying factors being
given-causes the favorable balance of trade to be a maximum, is explicitly
said "by no means necessarily [to be] the most desirable rate
from every point of view." Thus it may involve lower real income per

'In emphasizing the role of the modern corporation as an organizational force in
American industry and the extent to which it has supplanted the individual entrepreneur,
I am not unmindful that the corporation has frequently been the means by which
ambitious individuals have enhanced their power and influence, or of the fact that in
eighteenth-century England the individual entrepreneur "organized" economic activity
in the process of production. The change in the status of the individual in economic
activity might be regarded as one of degree, but it is so great as to constitute a major
change in institutional arrangements.

7 I am not aware of any instances in which the rules of inference themselves have been
ideologically distorted. All the more frequent are instances in which the rigor of tests

risk of being wrong, mere variation in willingness to incur such a risk will suffice, even
apart from other reasons, to produce that well-known situation in which two statistical
economists draw opposite inferences from the same figures.

The original Cobb-Douglas series of Labor, Capital, and Product as published in the origi-
nal paper in 1927, were as follows: (1) Labor (L) =average number of employed wage earners
only. Salaried employees, officials, working proprietors, etc., were not included; (2) Capital
(C) =value of plant, buildings, and tools and machinery reduced to dollars of constant pur-
chasing power with annual increments of investment divided by a specially constructed index  of the relative cost of capital goods in which the wholesale prices of metals and metal products,
of building materials, and of wages were given the respective weights of 4, 2, and 3; (3) Prod-  uct (P) =the original Day index of physical production as published in the Review of Economic
Statistics, Vol. II (1920), pp. 328-29, and Vol. VI (1923), p. 201. For a fuller description see
Cobb and Douglas, "A Theory of Production," Am. Econi. Rev., Vol. XVIII, Suppl. (Mar.,
1928), pp. 139-65.
b The basic data used in Series II differ from those in Series I in that (1) labor now includes  clerical and salaried workers as well as wage earners; (2) The basic index of physical production  used-was the Day-Thomas revision as it appeared in The Growthz of Manufactures, 1899-1923,
Census Monograph VIII, instead of the earlier Day study which was used in Series I. Values  for the intercensal years were interpolated by the use of the earlier Day series, while I con-
structed a new index for leather. See Douglas, The Theory of Wages, pp. 174-76. The Day-
Thomas index gave slightly lower values for P for the terminal years than the earlier index
a The main difference which distinguishes Series III from Series II is that Labor (L) is de-  fined to be the relative total standard man hours worked in the various years by the combined
force of wage earners and clerical and salaried employees. This was obtained by multiplying  (a) the indexes of employment for the various years by (b) the indexes of the length in manu-  facturing of the standard working week. For data and methods see Douglas, Real Wages in the  United States, pp. 546-47.
d The essential distinguishing feature of Series IV is that the factor of time was eliminated  from the basic data, not from the logs of data. This was done by fitting trends to each of the  three series and expressing each index for a given year as a percentage of its trend. The basic
data themselves were, however, identical with those used in Series II.
* The series of Labor, Capita], and Product in the six cross-section studies have now been
reduced to an almost completely comparable basis: (1) Labor (L) =average number of wage

side of the line BB' two other pairs of lines at the respective distances
of one and two standard errors of estimate. An inspection of these
charts for American manufacturing for the years 1889, 1899, 1904,
1909, 1914, and 1919, (Charts I, II, III, IV, V, and VI) show that in
practice the actual values tend to be close to the line BB', and a sta-
tistical analysis of these variations is given in Table V. Here it will be
seen that in every year more than 70 per cent of the actual values were
within one standard error of estimate of the values which we would

theoretically expect under the formula and that in two of the six years,
over 80 per cent of the cases were within this range.
Taking the 2185 industry observations in the United States as a
whole, we find that in 76.5 per cent of the cases, the actual products
were within one standard error of estimate of the theoretical products,
whereas under a normal distribution we would only expect a little over
68 per cent of the cases to lie within this range. Moreover, in only one
year did the number of observations whose actual products varied
from the theoretical values by more than two standard errors of esti-
mate come to as much as 6 per cent of the total while the average for
all 2185 observations was 4 per cent as compared with the 5 per cent
which we would normally expect.25

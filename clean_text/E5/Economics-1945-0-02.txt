response to his exhortation, I wish to open up with you a large subject
that is not merely of deep concern to American economists now. It
reaches beyond the borders of economics, back into the past and forward
into the future, unto the uttermost parts of the earth.

targets of our aim are balloons that invite puncturing-loose ideas and
vague phrases that befog thinking, slogans that masquerade as principles.
No less worthy targets are the cords that hold the veil over truths

G. P. Watkins did not exaggerate when he wrote thirty years ago:

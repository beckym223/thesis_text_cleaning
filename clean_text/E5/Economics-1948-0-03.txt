I. Introduction
A century and a third ago, in 1815, Malthus' and Sir Edward West2
simultaneously pointed out that if successive combined doses of labor
and capital were applied to a given piece of land, the amount of the
product would increase by diminishing increments. Two years later
this principle was adopted by Ricardo in his Principles of Political
Economy as the basis for his theory of distribution. The joint return to
labor and capital was declared by Ricardo to be governed by and to
be equal to the amount of product added by the last combined dose
of labor and capital, while the owners of land received as rent all
sums in excess of these amounts. Since the quantities of labor and
capital were not supposed to vary in relation to each other but were
instead bound together in fixed and unvarying proportions, there was
no way of isolating the specific contributions of these two factors as a
means of determining the rates of wages and of interest. These rates
were instead presumed to be regulated by cost-of-supply factors,
namely, the Malthusian forces governing population which would keep
wages down to a fixed minimum which was at least close to basic subsistence
and the low minimum needed to compensate savers and investors.
Such was the classical theory of distribution which dominated
economic thinking for over sixty years.
Meanwhile, in Germany, during the 1840's, Von Thiinen had theoretically
broken up the combined dose of labor and capital and had
pointed out that when each of the factors was separately increased
but the others held constant, the product increased by diminishing

used and, indeed, average only .92. This gives an unmistakable indication
of true diminishing returns so far as the size of individual

to clarify this point, it is suggested that quite possibly American plants
during this period were in practice developed beyond the point of
maximum efficiency. Whether or not the differences between the respective
k + j's can be taken as a coefficient of managerial megalomania,
I shall have to leave to the psychiatrists.24

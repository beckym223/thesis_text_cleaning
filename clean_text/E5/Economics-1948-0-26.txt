on the plant average basis than they are when industry aggregates are
used and, indeed, average only .92. This gives an unmistakable in-
dication of true diminishing returns so far as the size of individual

plants is concerned. While much more study is needed to develop and
to clarify this point, it is suggested that quite possibly American plants
during this period were in practice developed beyond the point of
maximum efficiency. Whether or not the differences between the re-
spective k + j's can be taken as a coefficient of managerial megalo-
mania, I shall have to leave to the psychiatrists.24

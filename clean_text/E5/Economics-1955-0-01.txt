The central theme of this paper is the character and causes of longterm
changes in the personal distribution of income. Does inequality
in the distribution of income increase or decrease in the course of a
country's economic growth? What factors determine the secular level
and trends of income inequalities?

These are broad questions in a field of study that has been plagued
by looseness in definitions, unusual scarcity of data, and pressures of
strongly held opinions. While we cannot completely avoid the resulting
difficulties, it may help to specify the characteristics of the size-ofincome
distributions that we want to examine and the movements of
which we want to explain.

Five specifications may be listed. First, the units for which incomes
are recorded and grouped should be family-expenditure units, properly
adjusted for the number of persons in each-rather than income recipients
for whom the relations between receipt and use of income can
be widely diverse. Second, the distribution should be complete, i.e.,
should cover all units in a country rather than a segment either at the
upper or lower tail. Third, if possible we should segregate the units
whose main income earners are either still in the learning or already in
the retired stages of their life cycle-to avoid complicating the picture
by including incomes not associated with full-time, full-fledged participation
in economic activity. Fourth, income should be defined as it is now
for national income in this country, i.e., received by individuals, including
income in kind, before and after direct taxes, excluding capital
gains. Fifth, the units should be grouped by secular levels of income,
free of cyclical and other transient disturbances.
For such a distribution of mature expenditure units by secular levels

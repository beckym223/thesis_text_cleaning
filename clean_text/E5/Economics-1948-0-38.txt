VI. To What Degree Do the Shares Which Labor and Capital Receive
of the Product Approximate the Proportions Which We Would
Expect from the Values of the Production Function?
We now come to one of the most important features of the theory of
production and of distribution, namely, the relative degree to which
the actual shares received by labor and capital approximate those


which we would expect from the values of the production function. As
my associates and I have demonstrated mathematically a number of
times, we would expect, under conditions of (1) true constant returns
where the sum of the exponents is equal to unity and (2) perfect
competition, that each factor of production would receive that fraction
of the total product which is indicated by its exponent.26

Although it is obvious that people acquire useful skills and knowl-
edge, it is not obvious that these skills and knowledge are a form of
capital, that this capital is in substantial part a product of deliberate
investment, that it has grown in Western societies at a much faster rate
than conventional (nonhuman) capital, and that its growth may well be
the most distinctive feature of the economic system. It has been widely
observed that increases in national output have been large compared
with the increases of land, man-hours, and physical reproducible capi-
tal. Investment in human capital is probably the major explanation for
this difference.
Much of what we call consumption constitutes investment in hu-
man capital. Direct expenditures on education, health, and internal
migration to take advantage of better job opportunities are clear exam-
ples. Earnings foregone by mature students attending school and by
workers acquiring on-the-job training are equally clear examples. Yet
nowhere do these enter into our national accounts. The use of leisure
time to improve skills and knowledge is widespread and it too is un-
recorded. In these and similar ways the quality of human effort can be
greatly improved and its productivity enhanced. I shall contend that
such investment in human capital accounts for most of the impressive
rise in the real earnings per worker.
I shall comment, first, on the reasons why economists have shied away
from the explicit analysis of investment in human capital, and then, on
the capacity of such investment to explain many a puzzle about eco-
nomic growth. Mainly, however, I shall concentrate on the scope and
substance of human capital and its formation. In closing I shall con-
sider some social and policy implications.

increasing development and use of power equipment fitted to smaller
farms. The Census data for 1954 indicate that 60 per cent of the farms
had one or more tractors, and 45 per cent had one or more motor trucks
at the time of the enumeration. The net effect will be a further reduction
in the number of farms and probably a reduction in farm labor force
per farm along with this. The following data are pertinent in this con-
nection:
Number of Farm Labor Labor Force
_________ Farms Force per Farm
1910 6,361,000 11,592,000 1.82
1920 6,448,000 11,449,000 1.78
1930 6,289,000 10,161,000 1.62
1940 6,097,000 ?9,540,000 1. 57
1950 5,382,000 7,507,000 1.40
1955 4,782,000* 6,583,000 1.37
* Preliminary.
Thus, even while the number of farms was holding about even from
1910 to 1930, the labor force per farm was declining a little because
more members of the family were in school, or engaged in off-farm
work, and a little less labor was being hired. An average labor force
of 1.25 workers per farm in 1975 looks plausible indeed.

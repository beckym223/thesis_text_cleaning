1921 to 1949, agriculture, measured both in physical volume and price,
grew at roughly-very roughly-the same rate as the economy as a
whole. The extent to which it fell behind in the 1930's was made up
in the war years and after. The stagnation of the economy as a whole
in the 1930's had much to do with agriculture's keeping up in these
years. But with the economy now surging forward with great vigor,
and no war or defense demand for our farm products abroad, agriculture
cannot possibly keep up with the rest of the economy. That it did

keep up in the period from 1929 to 1949 was in truth due only to abnormal
circumstances. If it gets too big physically and produces too
much, the prices sag, and values of output decline as they have since
1951. The normal for the years since 1948 should have been a roundingoff
of the advance, not a decrease.
Per Worker
Earnings and income data such as in Table IV and Chart III need
to be expressed on a per-worker basis in order to reveal their full meaning.
This is done in Table V. First, a comparison in terms of change

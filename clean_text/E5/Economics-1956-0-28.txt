prices. If an index of prices paid by farmers for family living items is
used instead, the constant dollar farm series will be 2.0, 1.7, and -0.4.5
A main reason for the greater gain in farm than in nonfarm income per
worker is the greater increase in total inputs used per worker in agricul-
ture than outside of it, shown in the last two columns of Table II. This
shows up in an increase in constant wholesale dollars of 2.5 times from
1910 to 1954 in gross farm product per worker in agriculture, compared
with an increase of 2.0 times in the nonfarm sector of the economy.
These determinations of incomes per worker and per farm point to
a great limitation of parity prices as a standard by which to measure
farm prosperity and well-being-they leave out entirely the contribu-
tion to income of increases in output per worker and per farm.
Per Capita
A full comparison of incomes and well-being, however, requires that
farm and nonfarm incomes be put on a per capita basis in terms of
the populations respectively supported by them, and also that any in-
come to the farm households from other than farming be counted in-
such as from work off the farm by any persons living in farm families,
from interest, dividends and rent receipts, from pensions and social
security-and similarly for the nonfarm group. This is done in Table
VI. Such aggregates are not available for the nonfarm sector before
1934. From 1940 to 1954, the farm income per capita multiplied 3.4
times in current dollars, and the nonfarm only 2.7 times. If the farm
people's income is converted to constant purchasing-power farm dol-
lars, and the same is done for nonfarm income using cost-of-living index
numbers, the comparison becomes 1.5 farm and 1.4 nonfarm. It will
be noted that the per capita farm population income has declined each
year but one since the 1951 peak.
In the period from 1934 to 1954, the income from other than farm-
ing has ranoged mostly between a third and fourth of the total income
of the farm population. In contrast, the income of the nonfarm popula-
tion from agricultural sources-rents, mortgage interest, etc.-ranged
between 1 and 2 per cent of its total.
For the whole period from 1910 to 1954, total income of the farm
population has increased 2.4 times in constant purchasing power dol-
lars, and that of the nonfarm population something less than 2.0 times,
as near as it can be judged from the available data.
It is clear from the foregoing that the per capita income of farm
people has been gaining on that of the nonfarm. But figuring more

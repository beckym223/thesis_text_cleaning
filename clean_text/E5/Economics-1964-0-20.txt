world or its annual increase it is quite small.2' The incidence of the 9
per cent over-all deterioration of the terms of trade on different areas
was, of course, very uneven. Latin America, for example, suffered a deterioration
almost double the average, the Middle East none at all, and
the rest of Asia (excluding Japan) one much smaller than the average.
But even in the area hardest hit-Latin America-the "importing
power of exports" (volume of exports multiplied by terms of trade, also
called "capacity to import") has substantially increased throughout
the period of 1950 to 1960 [4, p. 61]. As has frequently happened in
the past, the impact of the change in the terms of trade on the primary
exporters was partly offset by a sharp decline in freight rates which
were very high in the early 1950's.22 Since the middle of 1962, the international
trade situation of the less developed countries has improved
greatly, prices of many primary products have risen substantially, the
terms of trade did not show any further deterioration, and export earnings
have registered sizable increases.

Nobody can be sure how long that improvement will continue and
how far it will go. But assuming that the industrial countries avoid
serious depressions and maintain a good rate of growth, barring further
revolutionary technological changes (such as the invention of cheap synthetic
coffee) and highly protectionist policies on the part of the industrial
countries-under these not unreasonable assumptions the less developed
countries can look forward to a continuously expanding market

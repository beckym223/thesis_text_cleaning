Let us, therefore, compare the actual share which wages and salaries
formed of the net value product (i.e., W/P) in the various years with
the values of k. It will also be instructive to compare W/P with the
k
ratio of since the latter is a rough measure of what we would
k + j
approximately expect to occur if the total product were to be divided
between labor and capital so as to eliminate either net residual profits
or losses.
This is shown for the United States cross-section studies in Table
VIII. From an examination of this table, it will be seen that in five
of the six years there was a very close agreement between the values
of k and of W/P. In one year (1909), there was precise agreement
between the two; in two of the years (1904 and 1914), the differences
were approximately only one standard error, while in two more (1889
and 1899), they amounted to two to three standard errors. The biggest
difference was in 1919 when W/P was less than k by over eight stand-
ard errors."
Taking the average for the six years as a whole, we find that k
k
averages .63, equals .65, and labor's actual share or bl/P was
k+ j
.605. There was, therefore, a close average agreement for the period
between what we would have theoretically expected the distribution of
the product to be under conditions of perfect competition and that
which actually occurred. It should be remembered, moreover, that due
to our inability to deduct allowances for depreciation in specific in-
dustries, the true values of W/P are probably understated by ap-
proximately 3 percentage points,28 and that, therefore, the average
27 The year 1919 was one in which prices rose with great rapidity. It would be ex-
pected, therefore, that wages would lag behind in such a period.
2 On the basis of Dr. Fabricant's estimate of depreciation totals for manufacturing as
a whole in 1919, it appears that these amounted to approximately five per cent of the value
added by manufacturing in that year. If this had been deducted, labor's share would, there-
fore, have been raised in 1919 by about three percentage points, or to approximately .62.
Thus, Fabricant's careful allowance for depreciation in 1919 was 1151 millions of dollars.
(Solomon Fabricant, Capital Consumption and Adjustment, pp. 260-61.) The total value
added by manufacturing in that year, (i.e., value of product minus cost of raw material
minus rent and taxes minus cost of contract work) was 22,486 millions of dollars. This
comes to a depreciation rate in terms of net value of product of 5.1 per cent. If we deduct
such estimated charges, we would raise labor's share by almost precisely 3 points (i.e.,
5%5 = .62). Due to the smaller quantity of capital used per unit of product, in the earlier
years the additional "loading" required to approximate labor's share would then have been
somewhat less, and for 1889 and 1899 would probably have been nearer two percentage  points.

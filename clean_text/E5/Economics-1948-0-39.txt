Let us, therefore, compare the actual share which wages and salaries
formed of the net value product (i.e., W/P) in the various years with
the values of k. It will also be instructive to compare W/P with the
k

ratio of since the latter is a rough measure of what we would
k + j

approximately expect to occur if the total product were to be divided
between labor and capital so as to eliminate either net residual profits
or losses.

This is shown for the United States cross-section studies in Table
VIII. From an examination of this table, it will be seen that in five
of the six years there was a very close agreement between the values
of k and of W/P. In one year (1909), there was precise agreement
between the two; in two of the years (1904 and 1914), the differences
were approximately only one standard error, while in two more (1889
and 1899), they amounted to two to three standard errors. The biggest
difference was in 1919 when W/P was less than k by over eight standard
errors."

Taking the average for the six years as a whole, we find that k
k

averages .63, equals .65, and labor's actual share or bl/P was
k+ j

.605. There was, therefore, a close average agreement for the period
between what we would have theoretically expected the distribution of
the product to be under conditions of perfect competition and that
which actually occurred. It should be remembered, moreover, that due
to our inability to deduct allowances for depreciation in specific industries,
the true values of W/P are probably understated by approximately
3 percentage points,28 and that, therefore, the average

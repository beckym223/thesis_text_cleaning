27 The year 1919 was one in which prices rose with great rapidity. It would be expected,
therefore, that wages would lag behind in such a period.
2 On the basis of Dr. Fabricant's estimate of depreciation totals for manufacturing as
a whole in 1919, it appears that these amounted to approximately five per cent of the value
added by manufacturing in that year. If this had been deducted, labor's share would, therefore,
have been raised in 1919 by about three percentage points, or to approximately .62.
Thus, Fabricant's careful allowance for depreciation in 1919 was 1151 millions of dollars.
(Solomon Fabricant, Capital Consumption and Adjustment, pp. 260-61.) The total value
added by manufacturing in that year, (i.e., value of product minus cost of raw material
minus rent and taxes minus cost of contract work) was 22,486 millions of dollars. This
comes to a depreciation rate in terms of net value of product of 5.1 per cent. If we deduct
such estimated charges, we would raise labor's share by almost precisely 3 points (i.e.,
5%5 = .62). Due to the smaller quantity of capital used per unit of product, in the earlier
years the additional "loading" required to approximate labor's share would then have been
somewhat less, and for 1889 and 1899 would probably have been nearer two percentage  points.

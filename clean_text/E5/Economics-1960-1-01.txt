 lay in the fact that "the most noteworthy aspect of the usual income distribu-

 and I went on to suggest the vital role of credit rationing in truncating the 
 distribution.

 Errata 
 There are two typographical errors in the presidential address of Dr. Arthur 
 F. Burns, "Progress Towards Economic Stability," published in the March 
 1960 number of the American Economic Review. The first one is on page 1, 
 line 15, where the word "understanding" should be "understating." The second 
 one is on page 3, line 2, where "proprietorship" should be "proprietorships."

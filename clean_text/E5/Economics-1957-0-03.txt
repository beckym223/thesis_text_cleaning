It is well known that the original name for what is now generally
called "economics" was "political economy." Most of the treatises
written by the classical economists were books which they entitled
Political Economy. At its first annual meeting in 1886, the American
Economic Association adopted a four-point "platform," the first two
and the last paragraphs of which read:'

1. We regard the state as an agency whose positive assistance is one
of the indispensable conditions of human progress.
2. We believe that political economy as a science is still at an early
stage of its development. While we appreciate the work of former
economists, we look not so much to speculation as to the historical
and statistical study of actual conditions of economic life for the satisfactory
accomplishment of that development.

4. In the study of industrial and commercial policy we take no partisan
attitude. We believe in a progressive development of economic conditions,
which must be met by a corresponding development of
legislative policy.

And it also is noteworthy that the first publication of the American
Economic Association was Henry C. Adams' essay on The Relation of
the State to Industrial Action2-to my way of thinking still one of the
soundest treatments of the subject.

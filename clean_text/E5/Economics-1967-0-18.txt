tinuing shifts of position of competing oligopolists, and we have to turn to "the observa-
tion of facts," which would show us the variety of possibilities [29, pp. 601-2].
Schumpeter, in 1928, had this to say about the dichotomy: "We have much less reason
to expect that monopolists will . . . charge an equilibrium price than we have in the case
of perfect competition; for competing producers must charge it as a rule under penalty
of economic death, whilst monopolists, although having a motive to charge the monopo-
listic equilibrium price, are not forced to do so, but may be prevented from doing so by
other motives" [33, p. 371].
Finally, Scitovsky in 1951 stated that "not only does the monopolist's secure market
position enable him to relax his efforts of maximizing profit, but his very position may
prevent his aiming at maximum profit. He may regard his immunity from competition as
precarious or be afraid of unfavorable publicity and public censure; and for either reason,
he may judge it wiser to refrain from making full use of his monopoly position. We con-
clude, therefore, that although in some cases the monopolist will aim at maximizing his
profit . . . in other cases-which may well be the important ones-he will refrain from
maximizing profit" [37, p. 3771.

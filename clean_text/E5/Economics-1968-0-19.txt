By setting itself a steady course and keeping to it, the monetary au-
thority could make a major contribution to promoting economic stabil-
ity. By making that course one of steady but moderate growth in the
quantity of money, it would make a major contribution to avoidance of
either inflation or deflation of prices. Other forces would still affect the
economy, require change and adjustment, and disturb the even tenor of
our ways. But steady monetary growth would provide a monetary cli-
mate favorable to the effective operation of those basic forces of enter-
prise, ingenuity, invention, hard work, and thrift that are the true
springs of economic growth. That is the most that we can ask from
monetary policy at our present stage of knowledge. But that much-
and it is a great deal-is clearly within our reach.

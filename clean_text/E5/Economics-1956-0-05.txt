a The data for 1910, 1920 and 1930 are based on the gainful worker concept. Data for 1910
and 1920 include workers 10 to 14 years old. In 1930, there were 310,000 workers under 14
years old in agriculture.

workers were dammed up back on the farms because there were few
jobs open to them in the cities.
In terms of total farm employment considered by itself, the decline
from 1940 to 1950 was 1.5 per cent a year compared with 0.7 per cent in
1920-1930. In the three years from 1950 to 1953, it was at the rate of
2.7 per cent a year. The 1955 index of farm labor employment is 61
as compared with 62 in 1954 with 1910-14 as 100.
A hundred years earlier (1850), nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of
the U.S. labor force was working on its farms. The nonfarm labor
force multiplied 20 times during the century; the farm labor force
multiplied 2.4 times to its peak in 1910 and then fell more than one-
third.
Closely related to the foregoing is the percentage of the nation's
population living on farms-13.5 per cent in 1955 as compared with
16.6 per cent in 1950, 23.2 per cent in 1940, and 30.1 per cent in 1920.
These percentages are larger than those of the labor force because farm
families are larger than urban families, and because of the nonfarm
workers living in farm households. In 1955 (April), 36.6 per cent of
the employed persons in farm households were in nonagricultural em-
ployment. Only five years earlier, the comparable figure was 30 per
cent. The farm population was an eighth smaller in 1955 than in 1950.

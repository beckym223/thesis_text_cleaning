" Measured from the peak in 1951 caused by the Korean War boom and massive U.S.
stockpiling, the deterioration in the terms of trade would be substantially greater-14 or
16 per cent. The fact that the deterioration reflects a rise in import prices rather than a
fall in export prices is significant because unit values of manufactured goods have a notori-
ous upward bias, due to the fact that the gradual improvements in quality and the continu-
ous appearance of new manufactured products are not, or very insufficiently, taken into ac-
count. In other words, a rise in import prices (of manufactured goods) is much less "real"
than a fall of export prices (of primary products) would be.

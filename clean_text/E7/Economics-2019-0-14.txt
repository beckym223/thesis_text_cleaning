The first-order condition for utility maximization is given by
(1 − β) U′ ( C 1  )  = β RU′  ( C 2  )  .
The effect of a small increase in the transfer
D
on utility is gi
ven by
dU

=
[−  (1 − β) U′ ( C 1  )  + βU′  ( C 2  ) ] dD +  [ (1 − β) U′ ( C 1  ) dW + βKU′ ( C 2  ) dR]  .
The first term in brackets, call it
d
U
a   , represents the partial equilibrium, direct,
effect of the transfer. The second term, call it
d
U
b   , represents the general equilibrium
effect of the transfer through the induced change in wages and rates of return.
Consider the first term, the effect of debt on utility given labor and capital prices.
Using the first-order condition gives
(1)
d
U
a   =  [β (− RU′ ( C 2  )  + U′ ( C 2  ) ) ] dD = β (1 − R) U′ ( C 2  )  dD .
So, if
R

<

1

(the case known as “dynamic inefficiency”), then, ignoring the
other term, a small increase in the transfer increases welfare. The explanation is
straightforward. If
R

<

1
, the transfer gi
ves a higher rate of return to savers than
does capital.
Take the second term, the effect of debt on utility through the changes in
W

and

R
.
An increase in debt decreases capital and thus decreases the wage and increases
the rate of return on capital. What is the effect on welfareUsing
the factor price frontier relation
dW
/dR

=

−K/N

, or equivalently

dW

=

−K

dR

(given that
N

=

1
)
, rewrite this second term as
d
U
b   = −   [ (1 − β) U′ ( C 1  )  − βU′  ( C 2  ) ] K dR .
Using the first-order condition for utility maximization gi
ves
d
U
b   = −   [β (R − 1) U′ ( C 2  ) ] K dR .
So, if
R

<

1
then, just lik
e the first term, a small increase in the transfer increases
welfare (as the lower capital stock leads to an increase in the interest rate). The
explanation is again straightforward: given the factor price frontier relation, the decrease in the capital leads to an equal decrease in income in the first period and increase in income in the second period. If
R

<

1
, this is more attracti
ve than what
capital provides, and thus increases welfare.
Using the definition of the elasticity of substitution
η

≡
( F K    F N  ) / F KN  F , the definition
of the share of labor,
α

=
F
N  /F , and the relation between second deri vatives
of the production function,
F
NK   = −  K  F  KK   , this second term can be rewritten as

d

b   =  [β (1/η) α]  [ (R − 1) U′ ( C 2  ) ] R dK .

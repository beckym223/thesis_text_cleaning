version of the "dollar-a-day" global poverty line, which is $1.25 per person per day in 2005
international dollars, and show the well-known reduction in the global headcount ratio, from 51.9
percent of the developing world's population in 1981 to 25.2 percent in 2005. In spite of growth
in the world's population, the number of people in this kind of poverty has fallen by more than
half a billion in the last quarter century. Much of this success comes from China, in the East Asia
and Pacific region. The headcount ratio in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen only slowly, and there
are 176 million more Africans in poverty in 2005 than in 1981. South Asia, dominated by India,
is part success and part failure, and the Bank?and the government of India?estimate that, in
spite of a falling headcount ratio, there has been a small increase in the numbers of Indians in
poverty since 1981, in spite of India's relatively rapid growth in per capita GDP in recent years,
and its relatively slow rate of population growth. The overall improvement in global poverty and
the broad regional structure of that improvement show up in all versions of the counts. Even so,
it is worth noting that these counts are based entirely on household survey data, and that there
are often major discrepancies in growth rates between the survey data and the national accounts
so that the counts in Table 1 may understate the rate of poverty reduction; see Deaton (2005).  The last three columns in Table 1 look at three different sets of headcount ratios for 1993.
The International Comparison Program has updated its estimates of PPP exchange rates on an
irregular basis, with each round a substantial improvement on the previous one; the last three
benchmarking exercises were in 1985, 1993, and 2005 with a particularly marked increase in
consistency and coverage between the last two. The World Bank uses these estimates to update
its global poverty line?defined as the average PPP poverty line for a group of the world's poor
est countries?and to revise the conversions of that line into local currencies. The original pov
erty line of $1.01 in 1985 PPP ($370 per year, in World Bank 1990, Figure 2.1 and Table 2.1) rose
to $1.08 in 1993 international dollars, and to $1.25 in 2005 international dollars. By contrast, the
US CPI rose by 34 percent from 1985 to 1993 and a further 35 percent from 1993 to 2005; this
divergence is driven by the fact that ICP revisions move price levels upward in poor countries
relative to rich countries, so that poor country poverty lines are worth less in US dollars.
The revision from 1985 to 1993 had relatively little effect on the global count but made sub
Saharan Africa appear to be much poorer, and Latin America appear to be much less poor.
Indeed, it is the 1993 revision that "established" sub-Saharan Africa as the region with the

prices of electronic products fall every year, while the prices of services provided
by highly educated workers?notably health care?rise every year. An explosion of
recent research on grocery-store prices and on the prices of individual products in
the Consumer Price Index shows huge volatility. The stability of indexes cannot be
explained by the stability of prices of individual products. In particular, the idea that
sellers resist cutting individual prices is a complete non-starter. The explanation of
stable overall inflation appears to involve factors that operate across products and
not in individual product markets.
VII. How a Pinned Interest Rate Causes a Slump
A. The Non-Existence of a Standard Equilibrium in an Economy Where the
Government Attempts to Trade at the Wrong Price
To start the analysis of the implications of an interest rate that is too high because
it is pinned at zero, I'll use the Fisher diagram?the standard indifference curve
isoquant story applied to the intertemporal setting, shown in Figure 14. All households
 have the same preferences. The indifference curve describes preferences for
consumption in the first and second periods. The isoquant expresses the fact that, by
giving up current consumption, the household can invest in productive capital and
consume more in the second period. The tangency of the isoquant and the indifference
 curve is the equilibrium of the economy. The slope of the tangent line is one
plus the real interest rate at equilibrium. The economy achieves this equilibrium if
there are no other opportunities open to households.
At the beginning of period 1, the household has capital k0. Employment is nx
and output at the end of the period is yx =f(k09nl), which is divided between
immediate consumption cx and capital kx to carry forward to date 2, when the
household will consume the resulting output and depreciated capital y2 =f(ki9n2)

travel and automobiles are traded goods and, like telephone services, are heavily taxed in much
of Africa. Conversely, services?restaurant meals, hairdressing, and domestic service?are rela
tively cheap, as are locally grown foods like fresh vegetables. Precise quality matching may con
tribute to the high prices?for example in the specification of automobiles, and it probably does
so in the "other cereals" basic heading (in Table 5 in Kenya, but also important in other coun

that may not be representative of African consumption. But Table 5 identifies a different issue
that is probably more important, which is that the PPP of a country can be strongly affected by

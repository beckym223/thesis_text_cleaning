But back to thinking of it as debt. What if we do provide tax backing for the debt?
Suppose everything is as before, but now the government imposes a lump sum tax r
on the young each period. The government budget constraint is now
/ x jB, RBt_ i
<12> i=-ir-T'
Suppose there were an equilibrium in which savings is in the form of both bonds and
storage. Then both must have real gross rate of return 6. That makes the government
budget constraint
(13) T = eT±"r
't rr-l
This is a stable difference equation in B,/Pt. If it starts operation at t = 0, we will
have
B, B()
(14) ^ = ^_rr + 0< °
*t j=0 *0
But notice that, since 8 < 1, the right-hand side of this expression eventually becomes
negative, converging as t —> oo to — r/ ( 1 —6). That is, if the economy started on a
path satisfying this condition, eventually it would reach a point where the govern
ment is putting grain in the amount r on the market to exchange for mature debt, but
no one would have any debt to exchange for it. Anyone foreseeing this would have
a motive for holding on to some debt to exchange for grain at an extremely favor
able price ratio when everyone else had run out. So these paths cannot be equilibria.
By imposing the tax, no matter how small, the government has eliminated all those
equilibria in which storage and debt coexist. It has also eliminated the equilibria in
which debt is valueless (P, = oo) for the same reason: the government is trying to
exchange r units of grain per capita for mature debt, so the mature debt is necessar
ily of some value.
If there is no storage, the rate of return on debt can be positive. The tax is recog
nized by individual agents as reducing their wealth, so first-period consumption is
reduced. Formally, the private budget constraint in the first period is now
(15) cu + ^ + t= 1.
We will still have, from the first-order conditions, RP,/P,+l = p, = C2,r+i/Q, where
p, is just notation for the real rate of return. Using these last two expressions to
rewrite the first-period budget constraint, we have
~ i i ^2,t+i . P/C],
(16) Clt + t — — 1 — Cu -j — I- r.

Figures 2 and 3 taken from Cogley and Sargent (2005) frame the following puzzles. By the
early 1970s, the data had moved the government's prior to put probability approaching one on the
Lucas model that recommends zero inflation (see Figure 2). Why, nevertheless, was actual inflation
so high and variable in the 1970s? And why was the systematic part of inflation that emerges
from the Phelps problem (see Figure 3) even higher and more variable? Why did the Phelps planner
discount the recommendations of the Lucas model despite its high posterior probabilityThe
answer is to be found in what the Samuelson-Solow and Solow-Tobin models say would
happen if the Lucas zero-target-inflation policy were to be adopted (see Figure 4). The Phelps
problem weighs the submodel posterior probabilities against losses associated with various off
taken-path recommendations. In the early 1970s, their Keynesian direction of fit moved the coefficients
in those submodels in ways that pointed to very high sacrifice ratios. Despite their low
posterior probabilities, those models implied very high expected discounted losses if the Lucas
policy recommendation were to be implemented immediately. In contrast, the high-probability
Lucas model implied less adverse consequences if the recommendations of the Samuelson-Solow
or Solow-Tobin models were allowed to prevail. So the Cogley and Sargent story is that the Lucas
model's policy recommendation did not prevail in the 1970s because there remained a low probability
that it would be disastrous. In order for a low-inflation recommendation to emerge from
the Phelps problem, the estimated coefficients in the Samuelson-Solow and Solow-Tobin models
had to adjust in ways that would moderate the consequences of a low-inflation policy. That happened
by the mid-1980s.39

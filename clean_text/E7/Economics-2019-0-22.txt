So, a constant le

vel of debt can be thought of as an intergenerational transfer, with

a small difference relative to the case developed earlier. The difference is that a generation
born at time

es a net transfer of

t  f   when young, and receives, when old,

a net transfer of  D R

t+1  f   , as opposed to the one-for-one transfer studied earlier. Under

certainty, in steady state,   R

f   is constant and the two are equal. Under uncertainty, the

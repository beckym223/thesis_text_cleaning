these were something like the Internet purchasing guides of their day.
Figure 2 compares Douglas's and Rees's nominal pnce senes, and Figure 3 com
pares the resulting real wage indexes. It is apparent that, unlike Douglas's series,
Rees's price index remains stable in the face of increasing nominal wage rates.
Rees's price series thus implies an increase in real wage rates that Douglas's series
did not. An important puzzle about real wage rates in the United States during the
Industrial Revolution was not much of a puzzle at all. The lesson from this analysis
is that an investment in careful data appraisal can generate a large return in eco
nomic measurement.
Finally, Table 2 provides some evidence comparing real wage rates in various parts
of the world in 1914, the period when Rees concluded his measurement. In contrast
with the data in Table 1, the data in Table 2 tell a remarkable story of a dramatic wid
ening in the gap between wage rates in much of Europe and the United States com
pared to wage rates in most of the rest of the world. Real wage rates in London and
Canton, which two centuries earlier had been nearly the same, had diverged dramati
cally. As Table 2 shows, over a period of a century or two economic growth had been
so uneven that enormous gaps had opened up between what we now consider the rich
and the poor countries, resulting in real wage rates that were four to five times higher in
the rich countries. This raises the natural question of whether these gaps are likely to
persist and, if they do not, how best to measure them as they close.
III. Conceptual Real Wage Measures
As Figure 3 indicates, sizeable changes in real wage rates have historically been
accompanied by declines in normal hours of work. Indeed, the normal work week

even reasonably well, they could become rich very fast, and they would take over
the market. There are both smart money and noise traders in the market, the former
attempting to predict the latter.11 There is a large literature on value investing that
confirms that there has been a long-term return to doing it.12
In a bubble, the contagion is altered by the public attention to price increases: rapid
price increases boost the contagion rate of popular stories justifying that increase,
heightening demand and more price increases. In a stock market bubble, these might
be stories of the companies with glamorous new technology and of the people who
created the technology. In a housing bubble, these might be stories of clever people
making a fortune flipping houses. There can also be price-to-GDP-to-price feed-
back, if speculative price increases stimulate purchases and hence more increases,
price-to-corporate profits-to-price feedback, and price-to-regulatory laxity-to-price
feedback, all mediated by changing narratives (Shiller 1984, 2000, 2015).
The impact of the epidemic on the asset return would depend on the speed of the
epidemic relative to the discount rate. If the speed is very low, there would be very
little impact on short-term returns. Then the asset price changes would find little
short-term serial correlation through time, and would be approximately a random
walk over short time period

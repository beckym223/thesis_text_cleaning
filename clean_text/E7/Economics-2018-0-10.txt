there has been increased effort by the (anonymous)  proprietors of EJMR to monitor

Reaction included a petition addressed to the AEA by the International Association
for Feminist Economics (IAFE 2017), signed by more than 1,000 economists, and a
recommendation by the AEA’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP 2017) that the AEA set up an alternative site, to provide some
of the job market information available from EJMR in a less repugnant forum. The idea was that EJMR provided information that some economists were eager to have, but in an unsafe venue for women and others, and that the AEA might provide this information in a safer way. The AEA Executive Committee responded by conduct-ing a survey of department chairs about what kinds of in-progress job market information
they might be willing to share, and at the 2018 meeting it was decided to produce some non-anonymous websites for job market information in time for the 2018–2019 job market.

I’ll come back to this idea of moderating the impact of repugnant markets and
marketplaces by organizing competition for them via marketplaces that provide more acceptable alternatives when I speak about efforts to ban some markets, the black markets that arise in response, and the choices this raises about relaxing laws against markets that can’t effectively be eliminated.
To summarize, even these familiar, prosaic institutional features of the job market
for new economists illustrate some issues—like thickness, congestion, safety, and
repugnance—that often arise in the study of markets through their marketplaces, and which require attention when marketplaces are designed (Roth 2008).

Capital installation occurs up to the point where the marginal adjustment cost
equals the difference between the price of installed capital qk and the price of unin
stalled capital,/?^,:

Kt-\
The parameter k measures capital adjustment cost?if nk = 0, qk is always py r, and
there are no adjustment costs. Housing installation follows a similar equation with
subscript d replacing k.
The rental prices of capital and durables include the financial frictions/^ and

and

Here, rnt_{ is the nominal rate of interest for borrowing at the end of period t ? 1
and repaying at the end of period t.
The market-clearing condition for capital equates the value of the marginal product
of capital to the rental price:

B. Household Product Demand
Households fall into two categories, unconstrained ones who follow the standard
life-cycle intertemporal model, and constrained ones who are at the corner of their
intertemporal choice resulting from an inability to engage in unsecured borrowing
beyond a modest limit. Both types of households have active choices about the
division of spending between consumption of nondurable goods and services, on
the one hand, and the services of durable goods including housing, on the other
hand. A tilde (~) denotes unconstrained households and a bar (~) denotes constrained
ones.
Consumption is a Cobb-Douglas composite of consumption of standard output,
Cyft, and the services of durables, dt_x:

and similarly for constrained households. The price of composite consumption is

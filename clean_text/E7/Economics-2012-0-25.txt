VII. Concluding Remarks
My goal here has been to demonstrate how measures of wage rates that are com
parable across space and time may be used in economic analysis. I have tried to
stress the importance of assessing the underlying theoretical framework used for
measurement as well as how that framework can assist in the interpretation of what
we measure.
I began by providing just a little of the flavor of the long and distinguished history
of the measurement of real wage rates. In the past, measurement focused on changes
to wages within a given country over time. Today, much of the emphasis has shifted
to constructing credible measurements that permit comparisons of wage rates across
countries. In principle, we would like to accomplish both these comparisons with
one measure, but this is a virtual impossibility in a world where the quality and
nature of new goods changes rapidly.
One appealing aspect of measuring worker welfare with real wage rates is the
greater availability of the underlying data from historical periods. Recent histori
cal research has accumulated to the point where it seems possible to draw some
tentative conclusions. Real wage rates seem to have been remarkably similar across
countries before the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps only modestly above sub
sistence levels even in the best of circumstances. In the period since the Industrial
Revolution, real wage rates have diverged across countries, with catch-up taking
place in different countries at different points in time.
Finally, I have explored some data I have been engaged in collecting on wage
rates and prices in McDonald's restaurants over the last decade. These data suggest

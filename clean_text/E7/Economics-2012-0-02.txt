I. Introduction

There is a long history of measuring, recording, and comparing real wage rates,
dating at least from the Price Edicts of Diocletian in 301 AD.1 A nominal wage rate
($/hour) divided by the price of a good ($/good), is a transparent measure of how
much of the good an hour of work buys (good/hour). As such, a real wage rate pro
vides an important indicator of the living standards of workers. At the same time, the
nominal wage rate is a also a measure of the price of labor, and when it is divided
by the price of a good the worker produces it is a measure of how much of the good
an hour of work produces. Thus, real wage rates are also connected to measures of
labor productivity. This connection between wage rates, well-being, and productiv
ity is at the heart of the modern economic analysis of labor markets.

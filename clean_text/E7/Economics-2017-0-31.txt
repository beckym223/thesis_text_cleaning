Consider a narrative-based chronology of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Financial crises are driven by a cadence of stories. For example, stories about bank
runs were in the nineteenth century virtually synonymous with financial crises. But
after the Great Depression bank runs were thought to be cured. The Northern Rock
bank run in 2007, the first UK bank run since 1866, brought back the old narratives
of panicked depositors forming angry crowds outside closed banks. The story led
to a skittishness internationally, and to the Washington Mutual (WaMu) bank run a
year later in the United States, and, then, the Reserve Prime Fund run a few days
after that in 2008. These events then led to the very unconventional US government
guarantee of all US money market funds for a year. Apparently, governments were
aware that they could not let the old story of a bank run go live over concern for its
effects on public anxiety.

A narrative approach to understanding the crisis might take us back further in
time. In 2001, the UK television show Property Ladder was launched. This reality
TV show which depicted individuals buying homes, fixing and prettifying them a
little, and then reselling them at a large profit, was a big success. Successful narratives
are copied with appropriate changes and launched anew in other countries.

The US TV show Flip that House attempted to replicate Property Ladder in 2005,
but it was canceled at the time of the financial crisis in 2008. Property Ladder
lasted until 2009, renaming itself Property Snakes and Ladders, until its demise
later that year.

Leading up to the Great Recession 2007-2009, and setting the stage for it, were
widespread fears of long-term job insecurity because of advancing technology.
Facebook and Gmail appeared in 2004, YouTube in 2005, Twitter in 2006, and the
iPhone in 2007. These were the prominent business stories of the time, and they m

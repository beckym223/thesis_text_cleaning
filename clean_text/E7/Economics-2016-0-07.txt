Problem 1. - Imagine that you face the following pair of concurrent decisions.
First examine both decisions, and then indicate the options you prefer.

Decision (i) Choose between:

A. A sure gain of $240 [84%]

B . 25 % chance to gain $ 1 ,000 and

75% chance to gain or lose nothing [16%]

Decision (ii) Choose between:

C. A sure loss of $750 [13%]

D. A 75% chance to lose $1,000 and a

25% chance to lose nothing [87%]

The numbers in brackets indicate the percentage of subjects that chose that option.
We observe a pattern that was frequently displayed: subjects were risk averse in the
domain of gains but risk seeking in the domain of losses. It is not immediately obvious
that there is anything particularly disturbing about these choices; that is, until
one studies the following problem.

Problem 2. - Choose between:

E. 25% chance to win $240

and 75% chance to lose $760 [0%]

F. 25% chance to win $250

and 75% chance to lose $750 [100%]

Inspection reveals that although Problem 2 is worded differently, its choices are formally
identical to those in Problem 1. The difference is that some simple arithmetic
has been performed for the subjects. Once these calculations are made it becomes
clear to every subject that option F dominates option E, and everyone chooses
accordingly. The difficulty, of course, is that option E, which no one selects, is made
up of the combination of options A and D, both of which were chosen by a large
majority of subjects, while option F, which everyone selects, is a combination of B
and C, options that were highly unpopular in Problem 1. Thus this pair of problems
illustrates two findings that are embarrassing to rational choice adherents. First, subjects'
answers depend on the way a problem is worded or "framed," behavior that is
inconsistent with almost any formal model. Second, by utilizing clever framing, a
majority of subjects can be induced to select a pair of options that are dominated by
another pair. Once again, this behavior does not seem consistent with the idea that
people are choosing as Â«/they are rational.

B. Experiments, Incentives, and Learning

A second class of explainawaytions emerged in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to
the findings of Kahneman and Tversky and an early paper of mine (Thaler 1980).
These retorts, usually delivered orally in workshops and conference presentations
rather than in print,2 were intended to be justifications for continuing busin

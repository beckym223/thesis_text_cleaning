A. Complete Markets and Survival
In a finite-horizon setting, J. Michael Harrison and David M. Kreps (1979) showed that when
there are complete markets, the stochastic discount factor
... ?k,(c,+.0O) /,(*>+il*0
() m,+l P u[{cut{x')) f{xM\x')
is unique. Here,/(xr+1 \xl) =f(xt+i \x\p) is a common physical conditional density parameterized
 by the vector p.8 Because offsetting differences in marginal utility functions and probabilities
 can leave the left side of (4) unaltered, the uniqueness of the stochastic discount factor allows
for different densities/. Suppose that density/actually governs outcomes. Lawrence Blume and
David Easley (2006) showed that in complete markets economies with Pareto optimal allocations
 and an infinite horizon, the/(xx)'s of agents who have positive wealth in the limit merge
to the density that is closest to the truth f(x?).9 Merging means that the densities agree about tail
events.10 If fi(x?) =f(x?) for some /, then for an infinite horizon complete markets economy with
a Pareto optimal allocation, this survival result implies the rational expectations assumption,
provided that agents have access to an infinite history of observations at time 0.
B. Incomplete Markets
Sanford J. Grossman and Robert J. Shiller (1981), Lars Peter Hansen and Kenneth J. Singleton
(1983), and Hansen and Scott F. Richard (1987) wanted an econometric framework to apply to
incomplete markets where Blume and Easley's complete markets survival argument doesn't hold
true.11 Hansen and Singleton (1983) and Hansen and Richard (1987) simply imposed rational
expectations and made enough stationarity assumptions to validate a Law of Large Numbers that
gives GMM or maximum likelihood estimators good asymptotic properties. Under the rational
expectations assumption, (3) imposes testable restrictions on the empirical joint distribution of
returns and either individual or aggregate consumption.
C. An Empirical Reason to Allow for Belief Heterogeneity
Many have followed Hansen and Singleton (1983) and Hansen and Richard (1987) by imposing
 rational expectations, letting u (c) = cl~y/(l - y), and defining the stochastic discount factor
as the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution

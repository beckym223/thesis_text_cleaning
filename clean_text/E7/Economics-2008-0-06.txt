expectations about government actions.4,5 A system of expectations is a history-dependent
strategy like equation (1). A credible government policy gives a government incentives to
confirm prior expectations about its future actions, actions it cannot commit to because it
chooses sequentially.6 There are multiple equilibrium systems of expectations that a government
would want to confirm, with incentive constraints linking good and bad ones.
These theoretical rational expectations results have determined the way monetary policy
is now discussed within central banks. Because central banks want to implement solutions of
Ramsey problems like (b) in contexts like (a) in which the distinction between foreseen and
unforeseen policy actions is important, a time inconsistency problem like (c) arises, prompting
them to focus on ways like (d) to sustain good expectations.7
II. Justifications for Equating Objective and Subjective Distributions
These and many other theoretical results hinge on the part of the rational expectations equilibrium
concept that equates subjective distributions for endogenous variables to an equilibrium
distribution. To gain empirical content, rational expectations models also take the logically distinct
step of equating an equilibrium distribution to the data generating distribution. I shall use
asset pricing theory to illustrate two justifications for that step, one based on a survival argument
that says that agents with beliefs closest to the truth will eventually determine market prices,
another on empirical convenience.

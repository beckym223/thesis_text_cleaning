even more striking. By 2007, for example, before the recent recession, weekly hours
worked in US manufacturing were around 40. At current wage rates, weekly earn
ings would be 50 percent higher today than they actually are if work hours had not
declined so dramatically since 1890. Clearly, a considerable part of the increase in
the real hourly wage was used to reduce hours at work.3

As Pencavel (1977) noted, the implication of a negatively sloped long-run labor
supply function is that observed earnings or income differences may be a mislead
ing measure of welfare differences when wages rates differ dramatically. It follows
that an appropriate measure of the real wage rate that is intended to measure welfare
should be based on a model in which labor supply and commodity consumption are
selected jointly by a consumer-worker.

A. Constant-Utility Indexes of Real Wages

In the conventional setup a consumer-worker maximizes utility u(l, c) subject to
the budget constraint pc = wh + y, where c indicates consumption goods, w is the
nominal wage rate, p is a set of prices of consumption goods, h = T — I is hours
worked, I is nonwork time, T is the total time endowment, and y is income unrelated
to work. The usual first-order conditions lead to a labor supply function h(w,p,y)
and commodity demand functions c, = c, (w,p,y) and, after substitution, to the indi
rect utility function u{T — h(w,p,y),c(w,p,y)) = v(w,p,y).

The solution of v(w,p,y) for w* = w*(p,y,v*) is the lowest wage rate that permits
a consumer with nonwork income, y, facing prices, p, to reach the reference utility
level V*. The function w* provides the basis for a constant-utility index number of
real wages. A comparison of the observed w with w* indicates whether the worker's

Notes: Regression sample includes individuals working > 9 hours per week in the given year. Law school perfor-  mance includes law school GPA at graduation and whether on law review. Sample for columns 7 and 8 is restricted  to those working in law firms who reported an hourly fee. Weights are the inverse of the predicted values from a pro-  bit regression on whether the survey was returned using a set of predetermined variables such as law school GPA.  Standard errors are in parentheses.

B. Law ( JD ): Nonlinear Occupations
The gender gap in earnings between male and female JDs, graduating from the
University of Michigan Law School from 1982 to 1991, is nil at the start of employ-
ment. The gap is small and insignificant at year 5, after controlling for hours, weeks
and time off, as can be seen in Table 3, columns 1 to 3.40 But as in the case of the
MBAs the gap balloons to around 55 log points by year 15 in a longitudinal sample
40The University of Michigan Alumni Survey Research Dataset is used, which includes alumni surveys from  1967 through 2006 for persons graduating from 1952 to 2001 together with administrative data on each alumnus.  The surveys were sent to classes 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 years after receiving their JD. Because response rates for the  cross-section data are high (in the 60 percent range), surveys were later linked, where possible, to create a longitu-  dinal dataset. The information used here is from the longitudinal data linking individuals from graduation to years  5 and 15. See Wood, Corcoran, and Courant (1993) for similar work using a much earlier form of the cross-section  data and Noonan, Corcoran, and Courant (2005) for work that uses the more recent longitudinal samples.

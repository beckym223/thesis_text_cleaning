II. Inter generational Transfers and Welfare
Debt rollovers are, by their nature, non-steady-state phenomena, and have poten-
tially complex dynamics and welfare effects. It is useful to start by looking at a sim-
pler policy, namely a transfer from the young to the old (equivalent to pay-as-you-go social security), and then to return to debt and debt rollovers in the next section.
The natural setup to explore the issues is an overlapping generation model under
uncertainty. The overlapping generation structure implies a real effect of intergen-erational transfers or debt, and the presence of uncertainty allows to distinguish between the safe rate and the risky marginal product of capital.

I proceed in two steps, first briefly reviewing the effects of a transfer under
certainty, following Diamond (1965), then extending it to allow for uncertainty. (Derivations are given in online Appendix B.)

Assume that the economy is populated by people who live for two periods, work-
ing in the first period, and consuming in both periods. Their utility is given by
U

=
(1 − β) U ( C 1  )  + βU  ( C 2  )  ,
where
C
1    and   C  2    are consumption in the first and the second period of life, respec-
tively. (As I limit myself for the moment to looking at the effects of the transfer
on utility in steady state, there is no need for now for a time index.) Their first and
second period budget constraints are given by
C
1   = W  −  K  −  D;   C  2   = RK  +  D  ,
where
W
is the w
age,
K
is sa
ving (equivalently, next period capital),
D
is the transfer
from young to old, and
R
is the rate of return on capital.
I ignore population gro
wth and technological progress, so the growth rate is equal
to zero. Production is given by a constant returns production function,
Y

=

F
(K, N)  .
It is convenient to normalize labor to 1, so  Y

=

F
(K, 1)  . Both factors are paid

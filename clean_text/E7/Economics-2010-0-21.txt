price indexes for consumption between Africa and the OECD, and Asia and the OECD. In their
adjusted multilateral form, these regional PPPs are the numbers that are used to scale up the
within-region PPPs and are obviously important for measuring inequality, because they move
whole areas of the world up or down in concert. Table 6, which is in the same format as Table 5,
shows the influential basic heads for Africa and for Asia-Pacific relative to the OECD, again
using the T?rnqvist to illustrate.

Not surprisingly, some of the same goods in Table 5 reappear in Table 6, because their
prices are high throughout Africa, but several of the basic headings not included in the ring
play a large part in shaping the regional PPPs. Perhaps most worrying is the role of actual and
imputed rentals of housing, which is bottom of the African list, reducing the African to OECD
price level by 4.2 percent, but top of the Asia-Pacific list, raising the Asia-Pacific to OECD
price level by 5.9 percent. As we have already seen, these housing parities are imputations, and
the low figure for Africa comes from the fact that several African countries do not impute rents
in their national accounts. The various medical services that also appear at the bottom of the
list are almost certainly genuinely cheap, but the quality question again arises because these
services are not precisely matched as in the ring list. While precise matching is not the answer,
neither is the assumption that the same medical procedure is of the same quality in Zambia and
Britain. Pharmaceuticals, which are priced in the ring using precise specifications (acetamino
phen, acetylsalicylic acid, aciclovir, amitriptyline, amoxicillin, artesunate, atenolol, and so on
through the alphabet, with international, national, and generic brands for each), would have
shown up in Table 5 given a few more rows, and, like passenger travel by air, have a tiny budget

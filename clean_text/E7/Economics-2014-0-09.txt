Taking the case of gender gaps by occupation for college graduates (full-time,
full-year), the aggregate gap is 0.323 log points. Of that difference, 68 percent is
due to the within gap and 32 percent to the between gap when the male weights and
the female earnings are used. If the opposite is used (the female weights and male
earnings) 58 percent is due to the within gap and 42 percent to the between.
The main takeaway is that what is going on within occupations - even when there
are 469 of them as in the case of the Census and ACS - is far more important to the
gender gap in earnings than is the distribution of men and women by occupations.
That is an extremely useful clue to what must be in the last chapter. If earnings gaps
within occupations are more important than the distribution of individuals by occupations
then looking at specific occupations should provide further evidence on how
to equalize earnings by gender. Furthermore, it means that changing the gender mix
of occupations will not do the trick.
Gender Differences in Pay for High-Earning Occupations. - To further understand
differences by occupations, I estimate log earnings equations using the 2009
to 2011 ACS including various observables, such as a quartic in age, education
dummies, race, years, log hours, and log weeks. The regression also includes occupation
dummies, a female dummy, and an interaction of occupation and female.
Three versions of the residual gender difference by occupation have been g

that there are extraordinarily large differences in the wage rates received by workers
doing the same work and using the same skills in the rich and poor countries. These
data also show that there has been some remarkable growth in the world's low-wage
countries in the last decade, but that this growth has slowed, and in many cases
halted, since the start of the recent financial crisis. I hope that the future evolution of
real wage rates in both poor and rich countries will be measured more systematically
in the future than has been the case in the past.

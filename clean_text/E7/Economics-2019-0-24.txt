f   absent debt corresponding to âˆ’1 percent for the annual safe rate, and 2 percent
for the annual risky rate.

Failure is defined as the point where the safe rate becomes sufficiently large
and positive (so that the probability that debt does not explode becomes very
small, depending on the unlikely realization of successive large positive shocks
which would take the safe rate back below the growth rate). Rather arbitrarily, I choose the threshold to be 1 percent at an annual rate. If the debt rollover fails, I assume, again arbitrarily and too strongly, that all debt is paid back through a tax on the young. This exaggerates the effect of failure on the young in that period, but is simplest to capture.

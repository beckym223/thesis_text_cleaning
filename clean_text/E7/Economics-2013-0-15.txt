r=p from (22). From (21) this implies also that r — 0. The policy equation (21),
since it holds in actual (not expected-right) derivatives, implies that the time path of
r — ~¡0p is differentiable, even at the initial date t = 0, but this leaves it possible that
both p and r jump discontinuously at t = 0, so long as the jumps satisfy Ar = *y9Ap.
This makes the initial price level determinate. Using r$, pô to indicate the left limits
of these variables at time 0 (i.e., their pre-jump values), we have

(24) Ar0 = p - ro = oy6(p0 -pô) = 7&V0.

This equation can be solved for a unique value of p0 (right limit of the log of the
price level at time 0) as a function of p, rjj", and pô

If the initial price level should be below this level, r and thus p would also be
lower, which implies inflation tends to — oo at an exponential rate. The policy
rule (21) cannot possibly be maintained on such a path, as it would require pushing
r to negative values. It is natural to suppose that there would be a shift in the rule at
very low inflation rates, with fiscal policy ruling out such a path. If the initial price
level and inflation rate are above the steady state level, the inflation rate rises at an
exponential rate. The opportunity costs of holding non-interest-bearing money bal
ances become arbitrarily high. If real balances are essential (utility is driven to — oo
as M/P —> 0), these explosive paths may be viable equilibria. If not, there may be
an upper bound on the interest rate above which real balances become zero. Paths on
which real balances shrink to zero in finite time may also be viable equilibria. Here
again, though, we can postulate a shift in policy at very high inflation rates that elim
inates these unstable paths, while leaving the stationary p = 0 equilibrium viable.
Cochrane finds these hypothetical policy shifts at high and low inflation rates,
which then never are observed in equilibrium, implausible. But suppose we add a
government budget constraint and fiscal policy, as did Leeper. The budget constraint,
with real debt (not log of real debt) denoted as b and primary surplus denoted as r, is
(25) b = (r — p)b — r.

A version of what Leeper calls a passive fiscal policy is

(26) r= -00 + (f>xb.

Along a perfect foresight path, where r — p + p, this gives us

(27) b = pb + (p0 — 4>x b.

With 4>x > p, this is a stable equation in b. No matter what the equilibrium time path
of p, real debt converges to 0o/(^i — p)- This equation can therefore play no role in
determining the price level, and thus cannot resolve the indeterminacy.

But what if we add to the right-hand side of (26) a positive response of the pri
mary surplus to inflation, i.e., replace (26) with

(28)  r= -4> o + <j>xb + 02vr?

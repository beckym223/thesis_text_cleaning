with, as usual with log utility, first-period consumption being half of total wealth
1 — r. With no storage, Cit+ C2t = 1, which implies

(17) C2, = i±±.

Note that in this unique equilibrium, the utility of each generation is log( 1 — r) +
log(l + r) + 21og(l/2), which is less than the upper bound of 21og(l/2). Thus with
r = 0, the utility-maximizing equilibrium exists, but is not unique, while small posi
tive values of r make equilibrium unique, and can approach the utility of the opti  mum for small r.
The debt valuation equation holds in these equilibria. The gross real interest rate
is p, = C2j+i/Cu = (1 + t)/(1 — r). From the government budget constraint, then,
we see that

and since B/P = C2/p is constant in the equilibrium,

Note that as r approaches zero, B/P does not approach zero, as this formula might
suggest, p = C2/Cl = (1 + r) / ( 1 — r) in equilibrium and substituting this for p in
(18) gives us

(19) Tr'-^r

Because p —* 1 as r —» 0, in other words, real debt converges to one half, its value in
the utility-maximizing equilibrium, as r —> 0, even though the debt valuation equa
tion (18) continues to hold.

To see how the initial price level is determined, we look at the initial government
budget constraint. R_x and B_x are given by history, so

This equation can be solved for a unique, positive value of P0, so long as

R,-\B,_x > 0. The subsequent sequence of prices is determined by the sequence of
policy choices for R„ with higher R, values producing higher inflation.

Figure 6 provides a comparison of the McWage deflated by two different price
indexes. The data in Figures 4 and 5 refer to wages measured in a common currency,
and they may therefore be considered as measured in the price of tradable com
modities. These measure the cost in a common currency of employing a worker. By
contrast, Figure 6 compares two measures that deflate the McWage by price indexes
that may be thought to measure the prices a consumer-worker faces for a basket
of goods (containing both tradable and nontradable goods) that consumer-workers
actually purchase.
The more common measure of a purchasing-power-price (PPP) index from the
ICP is used to deflate the McWage on the horizontal axis of Figure 6. A more uncon
ventional measure of purchasing power is used to deflate the McWage on the ver
tical axis: the price of a Big Mac. What is apparent from the comparison of the
PPP-deflated McWage and the measure of Big Macs per Hour Worked (BMPH) is
that they are very closely related.
The reason for this is apparent from Figure 7, which plots the Big Mac price
against the US dollar measure of the McWage. The motivation for this plot is
equation (3), which displays the same concave form as is displayed in the figure.
Figure 7 has an eerie resemblance to the plot of PPP prices against real GDP per
capita in Summers and Heston (1991), suggesting that both plots are reflecting the
Balassa-Samuelson effect noted above. The regression estimate of the parameter

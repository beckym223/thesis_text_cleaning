THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW APRIL 2020
For each policy rule, the mean loss across simulations is shown in the first col-
umn of the table. The loss for each simulation is defined as the sum of the squared 
deviations of inflation from target and of the unemployment rate from the natural 
unemployment rate (the “unemployment gap”), except that no penalty is assigned 
when unemployment is below the natural rate. Higher losses imply worse average 
performance. The results are not much affected if positive and negative unemploy-
ment gaps are treated symmetrically, as is more conventional, or if the loss is calcu-
lated in terms of the output gap instead of the unemployment gap. Mean losses are 
a useful summary measure that provides a natural way to rank alternative policies, 
evaluate the marginal benefits of new policy tools, or—by comparing losses of alter -
native policies to that of the unconstrained baseline Taylor rule—assess how close 
those policies can come to fully offsetting the effects of the lower bound.
Also shown in Tables 3 and 4, for each policy rule, are the mean unemployment 
gap across simulations, the mean inflation rate, the percentage of quarters in which 
the simulated economy is at the effective lower bound (ELB frequency), the mean 
duration of  lower-bound episodes (mean ELB duration), the mean stock of assets 
held by the central bank as the result of QE programs (in billions of dollars), and the 
mean peak stock of assets attained, all averaged over the 500 simulations of the rule.
There are several takeaways from Tables 3 and 4. First, as previous work has 
demonstrated, traditional policy rules with a 2 percent inflation target (and with no 
use of the new policy tools) perform quite poorly when neutral interest rates are 
low. For example, when   r   ∗   = 1 and   i   ∗   = 3 (Table 3), the baseline rule leaves the 
economy at the lower bound some 31 percent of the time, with mean inflation less 
than 1 percent, well short of the 2 percent target, and a mean unemployment gap of 
0.7 percent. When   r   ∗   = 0 and   i   ∗   = 2 (Table 4), the baseline policy rule leaves the Table 4—Performance of Alternative Policies in Stochastic Simulations

Research in semantic information and semiotics is advancing. For example,

machine translation is already somewhat able to pick which meaning of the word is
intended by looking at context, at other adjacent words. Semantic search took a big
leap forward in 2010 when Apple, Inc. introduced its Siri function, which allows
users to verbally ask a question like "What is the longest river in South Africa?"
and receive a direct verbal answer. Semantic search is now getting well established
around the world.

Semantic search may, however, take a long time to reach the abilities of the human
mind to understand narratives. In the meantime, researchers can still be quantitative
in the study of narratives if they use multiple research assistants with explicit
instructions to read narratives and to classify and quantify them for their essential
emotional driving force. Advances in psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence
may be relied upon to improve our sense of structure in narrative economics.
As research methods advance, and as more social media data accumulate, textual
analysis will be a stronger field in economics in coming years. It may allow us to
move beyond 1930s-style models of feedback, the "multiple rounds of expenditure,
" and get closer to all the kinds of feedback that really drive economic events.
And it will help us to better understand the kinds of deliberate manipulations and
deceptions we have been suffering under, and to formulate some positive economic
policies that take into account the background of narrat

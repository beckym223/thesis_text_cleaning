persistence. If that were the only factor explaining the slump, the economy would be
well on the way to recovery as of the end of 2010.

Evidence on the persistence of the two credit-related driving forces?consumer credit
standards and the financial friction?is mixed. This topic needs a lot more investigation.
The model solution here corresponds qualitatively with Romer's 1992 account
of the Great Depression and subsequent recovery. She shows that real interest rates
were cruelly high during the period from 1929 to 1933, when deflation was rampant.
Then the resumption of inflation and the continuation of zero nominal rates through
1941 resulted in quite negative real rates except around the recession of 1937. The
economy expanded rapidly during the periods of negative real rates. She attributes
the inflation not to conscious acts of the Fed, but to its passive response to gold
inflows resulting from the increase in the pegged price of gold and from events in
Europe. Thus, as in the model solution, a period of a pinned real interest rate caused
a huge contraction in activity and the release from the high real rate caused a rapid
expansion of activity.

X. Simple Sticky-Price and Sticky-Wage Models

The model developed here has three important properties that are departures from
standard economic thinking:

1. The rate of inflation in the price of output is close to exogenous,

2. Capital utilization falls in slumps, and

3. Real wages are sticky.

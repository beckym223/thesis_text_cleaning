interviews as they might wish in the three days of the meeting, and must choose
from hundreds of applicants those they will interview.

Many departments must therefore make strategic decisions about whom to interview.
They have to consider not only which candidates they like, but also which candidates are not too likely to receive other offers they would prefer. That is, in choosing whom to interview, departments have to consider not only how likely they would want to hire the candidate, but also how likely they would succeed, since they don’t have time to interview all the candidates who they might eventually be willing to hire. So the interviewing process is congested. As a step toward easing this con-gestion, in 2006 the AEA instituted a signaling mechanism that allows candidates to send a signal of particular interest to no more than two employers.
17 Because candidates

can send only two signals, signals are a scarce resource that can convey serious potential interest.
18 And interest in signals has been steadily growing.19

Note that two very different kinds of signals are sent via various channels, throughout
the courtship between candidates and employers that ultimately leads to match-ing applicants and jobs. On the one hand are signals about applicant quality.

market papers, for example, convey information about talents, accomplishments, and skills that signal why candidates should be interesting to employers (Spence 1973).
21 But congestion—e.g., the fact that many employers’ interview slots are in
short supply and must be carefully allocated—also makes it useful for candidates to signal that they are interested in particular jobs (Coles et al. 2010; Coles, Kushnir, and Niederle 2013). Because technology has made it easy to send many applica-tions, simply sending an application is no longer a strong signal of interest

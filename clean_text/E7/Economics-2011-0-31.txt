IX. The Model's Implications for an Economy Hit by Adverse Forces

when the Real Interest Rate Is Pinned

A. Scenario

I focus on a particular scenario to illustrate the principles. The scenario is only
loosely connected to actual events in the current slump. I consider an economy with
a fixed inflation rate at just below zero (ir ? ? 0.12 percent per year decline). The
stock of housing and consumer durables is 14 percent above normal at the outset,
which I take to be roughly late 2008. The stock of business capital k starts at its normal,
stationary level. Fifty-eight percent of consumption is in liquidity-constrained
households with debt-service commitments of 6.7 percent of GDP that are gradually
declining by 2 percent per quarter (st = (0.067)(0.98')). There is a financial friction
/equivalent to a property tax on both types of capital at 2 percent per year, gradually
declining at the same rate as for 5*.

I solve the model over a long horizon (40 years) with the initial conditions just
described. Macroeconomists often describe a dynamic model's properties in terms
of impulse response functions showing how an unexpected shock affects the key
variables starting from the time of the shock. My approach is different, because the
forces that became so harmful in the Great Slump did not strike as a shock, except for
the financial friction, but rather built up over about half a decade. Online Appendix D
discusses the relation between my approach and impulse response functions.

B. Results

Figure 17 shows the response of the unemployment rate to the combined effects
of the three adverse forces. Unemployment starts at a very high rate above 30 percent
and gradually declines during the four years that the interest rate is blocked
from declining below 0.12 percent. Once the economy is free of the limit on the
interest rate, the unemployment rate drops immediately to its normal 5.5 percent.

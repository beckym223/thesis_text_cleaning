The findings gleaned from each of the graphs are similar although the levels are
a bit different. In almost all cases the coefficient on female for each of the occupations
is negative. That should not come as a surprise since it is a reflection of
the lower earnings women receive relative to men in almost all occupations. If the
individual's past employment history was included, as it will be for specific occupations
presented later, the coefficients would be considerably smaller. Presented as in
Figure 2, the coefficients give the raw gender gap in pay adjusted for age, education
and time worked.
One way to think about the coefficient is that it is the penalty to being a woman
relative to a man of equal education and age, given hours and weeks of work for
each of the occupations. But why should the penalty differ so greatly by occupation,
even for occupations that are high paying?
Each of the occupations has been categorized into one of five sectors: Business,
Health, Science, Technology, and a miscellaneous group called "Other." Although
the categorization is generally clear (e.g., engineers in Technology; physicians in
Health), occupation descriptions and groupings of the occupations in 0*Net were
used for less obvious cases.19 The list of occupations by category is given in online

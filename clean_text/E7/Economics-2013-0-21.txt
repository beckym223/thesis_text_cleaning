The kinds of models that have been the staple of undergraduate macroeconom

ics teaching, with price level determined by balance between "money supply" and
"money demand," and money supply described using the "money multiplier," are
obsolete and provide little insight into the policy issues facing fiscal and mone
tary authorities in the last few years. There are relatively simple models available,
though, that could be taught in undergraduate and graduate courses and that would
allow discussion of current policy issues using clearer analytic foundations.

valuable policy space—can no longer fully compensate for the effects of the lower
bound. Moreover, in that case, any monetary policy approach, with or without the
new tools, is likely to involve extended periods of short rates at the lower bound, as
well as  longer-term yields that are often very low or negative, which may pose risks
to financial stability or impose other costs. Should the neutral rate ultimately prove
to be that low, then additional measures to increase policy space, including a mod-
erate increase in the inflation target or significantly greater reliance on active fiscal
policy for economic stabilization, might become necessary. For now, though, major
changes seem premature. A reasonable interim approach could involve working to
increase the countercyclicality of fiscal policy, for example, through increased use
of automatic stabilizers. And, of course, in any case, the Fed must work to keep
inflation expectations from falling below target, which would bring down the neutral
interest rate and limit policy space.
I began this lecture by referring to the victory over inflation under Fed chairs
V olcker and Greenspan, an experience that promoted the view among central bank-
ers that lower inflation is always better. We have come almost full circle: in a world
in which low nominal neutral rates threaten the capacity of central banks to respond
to recessions,  too-low inflation can be dangerous. Consistent with their declared
“symmetric” inflation targets, the Federal Reserve and other central banks should
defend against inflation that is too low as least as vigorously as they resist inflation
that is too high.

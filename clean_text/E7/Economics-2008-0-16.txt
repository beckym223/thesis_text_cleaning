and identity covariance, and p0 > 0, pl > 0, where p0 is the natural rate of unemployment and
px is the slope of the Phillips curve. The parameters p2 and p3 set the volatility of the shocks.
Through equation (20), which is the aggregate supply curve proposed by Lucas (1973), the model
captures a rational expectations version of the natural unemployment rate hypothesis that asserts
that the systematic component of inflation v does not affect the distribution of the unemployment
rate conditional on v. The government's one-period loss function is E(U2 + it2).
The government's approximating model denies the natural rate hypothesis by asserting that v
affects the probability distribution of U according to
(22) U = 60 + 0i(v + 63w2) + 62wl ;
(23) 77 = v + 03w2,
where the random vector w has the same distribution as w. Under the true model and the protocol
that the government chooses target inflation before the private sector sets its expectation of infla?
tion, the government's best policy is v = 0. However, under the approximating model (22)-(23),
the government's best policy is
<24) "*<*>-77*,
There exists a unique self-confirming equilibrium in which
(25) (0o)o = PO + P,h(eo),
(26) (0i)o=-Pi,
and (02)o ? PiX^^o ? P3- The self-confirming equilibrium equals the time-consistent equi?
librium of Kydland and Prescott (1977).28 An adaptive government's estimates 0, converge to
the self-confirming equilibrium vector 60, and the systematic part of inflation converges to v =
h{0o).
The data-matching restriction (25) pinpoints how the government mistakenly ignores the effect
of its policy choice v, which also equals the public's expected rate of inflation, on the position of
the Phillips curve. The population regression coefficient of ?Von 77 is 6X = ?PiP2/[var(v) + p2].
If historically v had been randomly generated with enough variance, then even though it fits the
wrong model, the government would estimate a Phillips curve slope 6X of approximately zero,
and according to (24) would set v approximately to its optimal value of 0 under the true model.29
But within an SCE, v doesn't vary enough for the government to estimate a 0X close enough to
zero for that to happen. Furthermore, the outcome that 6t -> 0o means that the variation of vt
that occurs along transient paths converging to an SCE is insufficient to allow the government's
model to approximate the data in a way that tells it to implement the optimal policy under the  true model.

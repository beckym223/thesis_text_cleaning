affect the data generating mechanism. It is different when people learning about an equilibrium
are inside the model. Their learning affects decisions and alters the distribution of endogenous
variables over time, making them aim at moving targets.
Suppose that an adaptive learner begins with an initial estimate 0O at time 0 and uses a recursive
 least squares learning algorithm
(16) 0t+x-0t = ee(0ny\v\t).
As in the models of learning in games of Dean P. Foster and H. Peyton Young (2003) and Young
(2004, ch. 8), we assume that decision makers mistakenly regard their time t model indexed by
0, as permanent and form the sequence of decisions20

where ht(xt\0) is the same function (13) that solves the original Phelps problem (12) under the
model/(jx, vx 10). The joint density of (jx, vx, 0X) becomes

The learning literature states restrictions on the estimator e and the densities/(-|0) and/(-|p)
that imply that

C. Applications of Adaptive Learning Models in Macroeconomics
One important application of adaptive models in macroeconomics has been to select among
multiple rational expectations equilibria (see Evans and Honkapohja (2001) for many useful
examples). Another has been to choose among alternative representations of policy rules from
Ramsey problems, a subset of which are stable under adaptive learning (Evans and Honkapohja
2003). Yet another has been to improve the fit of models of asset pricing and big inflations by
positing small gaps between an objective density and asset holders' subjective densities (e.g.,
Klaus Adam, Albert Marcet, and Juan Pablo Nicolini 2006; Marcet and Nicolini 2003). In the

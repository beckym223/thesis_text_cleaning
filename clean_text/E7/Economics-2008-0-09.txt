the agents inside the model. The econometrician's tools for learning 0 are (i) a likelihood function,
(ii) a time series or panel of observations drawn from the equilibrium distribution, and (iii)
a Law of Large Numbers, a Central Limit Theorem, and some large deviations theorems that
characterize limits, rates of convergence, and tail behaviors of estimators. With enough data and
a correct likelihood function, an econometrician can learn 0O.

A rational expectations equilibrium evaluated at a particular history is a likelihood function:
(7) L(x'\0)=f(x'\e)=f(xt\x'~\e)f(x^\x'-he)---f(xl\xo-e)f(xo\e).

The most confident and ambitious branch of rational expectations econometrics recommends
maximizing a likelihood function or combining it with a Bayesian prior p{0) to construct a
posterior p(0\xf)P In choosing 0 to maximize a likelihood function, a rational expectations
econometrician in effect searches simultaneously for a stochastic process of exogenous variables
and a system of expectations that prompts forward-looking artificial agents inside a model to
make decisions that best fit the data.14 Taking logs in (7) gives

(8) logL(?|x') - ?(x,|xf-1;0) + ?(x^x'"2;?) + - + ?(x,|x0;?) + ?(xo|0),

where ?(x,|x'_1;0) = log/folx'"1^). Define the score function as st(x\0) = 3?(xf |x'"~\0)/a0.  The first-order conditions for maximum likelihood estimation are
(9) -n-i>r(*T.4) = o.

By solving these equations, an econometrician finds a 0t that allows him to approximate the
equilibrium density very well as t -? +o?.

A. Using a Misspecified Model to Estimate a Better One

Lucas (1976) convinced us that nonstructural models are bad vehicles for policy analysis. But
the first-order conditions for estimating a good fitting nonstructural model can help to make
good inferences about parameters of a structural economic model.

Indirect estimation assumes that a researcher wants to estimate a parameter vector p of a
structural rational expectations model for which (1) analytical difficulties prevent evaluating a
likelihood function/^'|p) directly, and (2) computational methods allow simulating time series
from/(x'|p) at a given vector p. See Christian Gourieroux, Alain Monfort, and Eric Renault
(1993), A. A. Smith, Jr. (1993), and A. Ronald Gallant and George Tauchen (1996). Indirect
estimation carries along two models, a model of economic interest with an intractable likelihood
function, and an auxiliary purely statistical model with a tractable likelihood function that fits
the historical data well. The parameters of the economist's model p are interpretable in terms of
preferences, technologies, and information sets, while the parameters 0 of the auxiliary model
/(xr|0) are data fitting devices. The idea of Gallant and Tauchen (1996) is, first, to estimate the
auxiliary model by maximum likelihood, then to use the score functions for the auxiliary model
and the first-order conditions (9) to construct a GMM estimator that can be used in conjunction

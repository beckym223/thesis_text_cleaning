to be smaller in FRB/US than in other models (Chung 2015, Kiley and Roberts
2017). Nevertheless, to be conservative, I imposed the restriction that agents do not
expect forward guidance to be effective for more than 28 quarters. After that, they
expect policy to revert to the baseline Taylor rule. Assuming that guidance is credible
for as long as 28 quarters seems reasonable, because the guidance is at worst
mildly  time-inconsistent—the implied overshoots of the inflation target are small
and might well be welcome if the FOMC were concerned about reinforcing the

credibility of its symmetric inflation target after a period of inflation undershoot. In
any case, as will be seen, I do not find forward guidance to be particularly powerful
in my simulations, and my overall results do not rely on unrealistic foresight on the
part of the public.

Quantitative Easing.—Following Kiley (2018), I consider four alternative QE
policies, ranging from least aggressive (A) to most aggressive (D). In all cases, QE
is assumed to be deployed when the output gap has become sufficiently large. For
example, under QE(A), the least aggressive policy, QE is assumed to be initiated
when the output gap is 5 percent, with purchases continuing at a rate of $25 billion
per quarter for every percentage point that the output gap exceeds 5 percent. The
QE(D) policy, the most activist, is initiated when the output gap is 2.5 percent, at a
pace of $50 billion per quarter for each percentage point that the output gap exceeds
2.5 percent. For each of the QE programs, when the output gap shrinks sufficiently,
asset purchases are assumed to end, and the central bank’s balance sheet begins a
gradual  wind-down. (See Kiley 2018 or the online Appendix for precise specifications.
) The simulations keep track of the size of the central bank’s balance she

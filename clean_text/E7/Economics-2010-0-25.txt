measures are usefully correlated with standard objective measures of living standards. Changes
in self-reported measures are essentially uncorrelated with changes in the log of per capita GDP,
year by year or, for the three measures where we have them, over the two year period from
2006 to 2008. This could be interpreted as evidence that the self-reported measures are invalid,
and the lack of correlation between changes in the ladder and changes in income is consistent
with adaptation in life-evaluation over time (though not apparently over space) as first found by
Richard Easterlin (1974). Clearly our three years of data are insufficient to settle the Easterlin
hypothesis one way or the other. Both per capita GDP and the Gallup measures are subject to
sampling and non-sampling errors, so once again we will need larger and longer-term changes
to give a clearer picture. It is also not clear how well-correlated with income we would either
expect or want these measures to be. Indeed, if these measures were perfectly correlated with
average income, they would not be useful; we are attempting to measure something other than

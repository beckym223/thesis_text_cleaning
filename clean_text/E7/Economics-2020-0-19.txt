Distributional Considerations.—FOMC participants did not often discuss distributional
considerations—mainly, the effects of low interest rates on savers and

the purported tendency of the new monetary tools to increase inequality—nor were
these concerns included in the internal 2013 FOMC survey about potential costs.
However, these issues were (and remain) prominent in the political debate in the
United States and several other countries. Most policymakers believe that monetary
policies that promote economic recovery have broadly felt benefits, including higher
employment, wages, profits, capital investment, and tax revenues; lower borrowing
costs; and reduced risk of unwanted disinflation or even a deflationary trap. Given
these benefits, it would be unwise to avoid accommodative monetary policies even
if they did have some adverse distributional implications. In any case, the research
literature is close to unanimous in its finding that the distributional effects of expansionary
monetary policies are small, once all channels are considered, and may even
work in a progressive direction, for example by promoting a “hot” labor market.14
Inequality is primarily structural and slowly evolving rather than cyclical, and as
such should be addressed by the fiscal authorities and other policymakers, not central
banks.

Capital Losses.—The large, unhedged holdings of  longer-term securities associated
with asset purchase programs risked substantial capital losses if interest

rates had risen unexpectedly, losses which in turn could have ultimately reduced
the Federal Reserve’s remittances of profits to the Treasury.15 The social costs of
any such losses would probably have been small: they would not have affected the
ability of the Fed to operate normally, and—even ignoring offsetting gains to investors—
government revenue gains from a stronger economy would have more than

compensated for reduced remittances. Nevertheless, FOMC participants worried
about the political fallout and threats to Fed independence that large losses could
have produced.16

Several factors mitigated but did not eliminate this risk. First, a significant portion
of the Fed’s liabilities—namely currency—pays no interest, providing some

cushion to the Fed’s ability to make payments to the Treasury. Additional cushion
is provided by securities owned by the Fed prior to the introduction of QE, which
enjoyed capital gains when yields fell. Second, since the Fed earns the  long-term
interest rate on its holdings of bonds but pays the  short-term interest rate on bank
reserves, it earns a net positive return when the yield curve has its norm

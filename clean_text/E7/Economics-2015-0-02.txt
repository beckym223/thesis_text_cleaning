I. Bargaining and Climate Coalitions

A. Free-riding and the Westphalian System

Subject to many deep uncertainties, scientists and economists have developed an
extensive understanding of the science, technologies, and policies involved in climate
change and reducing emissions. Much analysis of the impact of national policies such
as cap-and-trade or carbon taxes, along with regulatory options, has been undertaken.
Notwithstanding this progress, it has up to now proven difficult to induce countries
to join in an international agreement with significant reductions in emissions.
The fundamental reason is the strong incentives for free-riding in current

international climate agreements. Free-riding occurs when a party receives the
benefits of a public good without contributing to the costs. In the case of the international
climate-change policy, countries have an incentive to rely on the emissions
reductions of others without taking proportionate domestic abatement. To this is
added temporal free-riding when the present generation benefits from enjoying
the consumption benefits of high carbon emissions, while future generations pay
for those emissions in lower consumption or a degraded environment. The

resulting from employment n2. The household orders consumption pairs according
to the utility function
(6) U(c{) + ?U{c2).
The utility function U is concave and differentiable. The household incurs no disa
menity from work, so it will normally choose to offer all of its time to the labor
market: nx ? n2 ? n.
Figure 15 shows the standard equilibrium. At the equilibrium, the interest rate r* is
the common value of the marginal product of capital and the marginal rate of substitution
between consumption in the first and second periods. The isoquant describes
the full-employment trade-off between cx and c2:
(7) c2 = f(n,f(n9ko - cx)).
Equilibrium definitions play a big role in this discussion. I start with
DEFINITION: A standard equilibrium in the two-period economy is a pair of consumption
levels (clt c2) and an interest rate r satisfying the equality of marginal rate
of substitution and marginal product of capital,
(g\ U'{Cl) - # - 1 + r
and material balance at full employment:
(9)  ci = f(n,f(n,k0 - d)).

In the last decades of the twentieth century, US monetary policy wrestled
with the problem of high and erratic inflation. That fight, led by Federal Reserve
chairs Paul V olcker and Alan Greenspan, succeeded. The result—low inflation and
well-anchored inflation expectations—provided critical support for economic stability
and growth in the 1980s and 1990s, in part by giving monetary policymakers
more scope to respond to  short-term fluctuations in employment and output without
having to worry about stoking high inflation.
However, with the advent of the new century, it became clear that low inflation
was not an unalloyed good. In combination with historically low real interest rates—
the result of demographic, technological, and other forces that raised desired global
saving relative to desired investment—low inflation (actual and expected) has translated
into persistently low nominal interest rates, at both the long and short end

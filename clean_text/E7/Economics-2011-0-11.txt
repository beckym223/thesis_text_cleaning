much the same effect as taxes?they create wedges and resulting inefficiencies, but
do not consume output.
A different type of friction occurs when a borrower is unable to perform on a
debt obligation. Another branch of the literature on financial frictions, starting from
Robert M. Townsend (1979), observes that debt contracts have the property that the
lender need not consume resources monitoring the borrower unless the borrower
fails to make good on the simple promise to repay the loan, an act that is costless
to verify. When the borrower is unable to repay, the lender incurs substantial costs
to recover value through a workout or bankruptcy. When borrowers suffer losses in
asset values, the probability of default rises and total spreads rise. The friction is less
than the spread, because one consequence of a default is a simple transfer of value
from the lender to the borrower. The friction is the amount of the loss accruing to
the borrower and lender jointly?it comprises bankruptcy costs, business interruption
costs, and the like. But the friction is likely to move in proportion to observed
spreads, so a widening of the total spread will usually indicate an increase in the
financial friction.
A. Credit Rationing and Lending Standards
Lenders always ration credit. They need to overcome substantial adverse selection
problems. They set standards for borrower eligibility and spend resources verifying
that borrowers meet the standards. One of the consequences of a slump, especially
one with an initial financial crisis, is a tightening of lending standards for both businesses
and households. Adverse selection becomes a more serious danger when
more borrowers are close to the margin of failure.
Lending standards are increasingly based on credit scores and other metrics, but I
am not aware of any systematic compilation of quantitative standards into an overall

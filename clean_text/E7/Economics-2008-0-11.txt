A decision maker has preferences ordered by
(12) jt/(/>*)/(/>10) ?(/>*)
and chooses a history-dependent plan
(13) v, = A,(*'|0), t>0
that maximizes (12). This gives rise to the sequence of decisions v (h \ 0)x. The difference between
this choice problem and the canonical intelligent design problem in Section I is the presence of
the approximating model f(y*, vx 10) in (12) rather than the true model that appeared in (2). I call
maximizing (12) a "Phelps problem" in honor of a policy design problem of Edmund S. Phelps
(1967) that will play an important role in Section VI.
DEFINITION 1: A self-confirming equilibrium (SCE) is a parameter vector 0ofor the approximating
 model that satisfies the data-matching conditions
d4) f(yx,v(h\0oY\6o) =f(y\v(h\Oor\p)
An SCE builds in, first, optimization of (12) given beliefs indexed by 0O, and, second, a 0 =
0O that satisfies the data matching conditions (14). Data matching prevails for events that occur
under the equilibrium policy v (h 10O)X, but it is possible that

true model for events that occur under the SCE government policy, but not necessarily under
alternative government policies.
B. Learning Converges to an SCE
An SCE is a possible limit point of an adaptive learning process. Margaret M. Bray and Kreps
(1987) distinguish between learning about an equilibrium and learning within an equilibrium.18
By saying about and not within, Bray and Kreps emphasize that the challenge is to analyze how a
system of agents can come to learn an endogenous objective distribution by using adaptive algorithms
 that do not simply apply Bayes's law to a correct probability model.19 We cannot appeal
to the same econometrics that lets a rational expectations econometrician learn an equilibrium
because an econometrician is outside the model and his learning is a sideshow that does not

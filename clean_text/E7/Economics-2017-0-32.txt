have left the impression that the companies that were forming might not be creating
jobs for those not technologically gifted or connected with other such people.
The very name Great Recession could be interpreted as evidence of a narrative
epidemic. Naming the financial crisis after the Great Depression was not the
choice of any one individual. There had been earlier attempts to attach the name
Great Recession to preceding recessions. Otto Eckstein wrote a book entitled The
Great Recession in 1978 that attempted to attach this name to the severe 1974-1975
recession. However, the name did not stick. Again in the 1981-1982 recession this
term was used by Joseph Granville, the flamboyant analyst who stirred much talk
about his prediction of stock market drops by engaging in stunts such as appearing
at events with a trained chimpanzee.30 But again, the name did not go viral. It
was different, however, in 2007-2009. Nouriel Roubini first referred to the "Great
Recession of 2007" in late 2006, a year before the recession had started.31 But it
took several more years, until 2009, for the term to catch on and go viral.
The Great Depression of the 1930s has long been associated in the public mind
with the "Stock market crash of 1929" that preceded it. Most people appear to be
wary of attaching grandiose names to events, unless there is authority justifying
that. Lionel Robbins was successful with his book title, The Great Depression in
1934 because President Roosevelt, a generally recognized authority, had used the
words,32 suggesting the worst economic contraction ever. It is conceivable that naming
the event thus might have been a self-fulfilling prophecy in that it created worries
and uncertainty, perhaps contributing to the persistence of a depressed economy.
What is it about the 2007-2009 event that made the name Great Recession suddenly
contagious? Judging from the peak US unemployment rate, it was less severe
than the 1981-1982 recession.
Perhaps it was because the 2007-2009 event fit the most generic and ill-informed
memories of the Great Depression. People remember massive bank failures as part
of the Great Depression story, and that was a better fit, it appeared, with the events of
2007. In the 1981-1982 recession the stock market had not recently been booming
(it had never recovered from the 1974-1975 crash, which still seemed like a recent
major event in 1981), and the stock market did not fall below its 1980 value by 1982.
In contrast, 2007-2009 saw a halving of the market from very high levels. People in
1981-1982 were, as public opinion polls confirm, preoccupied with out-of-control
consumer-price inflation, and saw the events in terms of a suddenly strong central
bank effort to contain the inflation.
Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's representativeness heuristic
is the principle that people judge current events by their similarity to memories
of representative events. The Great Depression was a model that is exaggerated in
people's minds because of its legendary status. In 2007-2009 presidents and prime
ministers invoked parallels to the Great Depression to justify their requests to apply
stimulus. Did this contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy, a mirror event

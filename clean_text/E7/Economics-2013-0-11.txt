Let savings be represented by W, — S, + Bt/Pt. Logarithmic utility makes solution
easy because it implies that whatever the rate of return to savings, call it p„ we will
have p = C2,r+i/Clr, and this in turn implies that

Thus savings is always half the endowment, i.e., 0.5.

This economy has an equilibrium in which there is no storage and nominal debt
has value (i.e., P, < oo). With no storage, Cu = 0.5 and, since savings is all used to
buy debt from the older generation, C2, = 0.5 also. This means p, = 1 and therefore
R = P,+l/P„ all t. In other words, the price level grows at the gross interest rate and
the real value of both newly issued and maturing debt is constant at 0.5. In order for
this equilibrium to prevail, the initial price level P¡ must be 2Bt, i.e., 2RB0.
The economy also has equilibria in which S(>0, however. In these equilibria, of
course, p = 9 = RPt/Pt+l. In other words, The price level grows not at the rate R,
but at the higher rate R/0. The nominal debt still grows at the rate R, however, so the
real debt shrinks over time, with

The economy can start with any Bx/ Px < 0.5. Storage will then be 5] = 0.5 —
Bx/P{. In subsequent periods, S, increases toward 0.5 as the real value of savings in
the form of nominal bonds shrinks toward zero.

In other words, every initial price level PA that exceeds 2RB0, including P{ = oo
(in which case bonds are valueless and all savings is in the form of storage), corre
sponds to a perfect-foresight equilibrium in this economy. This is an economy with
an indeterminate price level.

Note that the economy's resource constraint is Cu + C2, + S, — 1 + 9S,_i: con
sumption and storage by the young plus consumption by the old is endowment of
the young plus the proceeds from storage by the old. Since in all the equilibria
with positive storage S is either increasing or (when P, = oo) constant, and since
Clt = 0.5, C2, < 0.5 in all these equilibria with Sr>0. That is, these equilibria
with S, > 0 are strictly worse than the one in which S, = 0. It may be comforting to
believe that somehow these worse equilibria would be avoided, but there is nothing
in the structure of the model that should make the worse equilibria less likely.
When we use the "6" and "/?" notation as here, it is perhaps unsurprising that
we get an indeterminate equilibrium when the government issues debt without
any backing from taxation. But if we replace B by M and set R = 1, this becomes
Samuelson's model of "money" and is sometimes taken as a useful metaphor to aid
understanding of how fiat money can have value.

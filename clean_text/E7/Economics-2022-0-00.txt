In the textbook model of labor markets—synthesized by Hicks (1932)—product
and factor markets are perfectly competitive and wages are equated to marginal prod-
ucts.1 Just one year after Hicks, Robinson (1933) developed an alternative framework
for understanding  firm-specific wage setting and coined the term “monopsony.” The
book attracted a lot of attention, and at least some labor economists were enthusi-
astic. Reynolds (1946, p. 390) wrote that the concept of an  upward-sloping supply
curve of labor to the firm “… has made its way rapidly into the textbooks and seems
well on its way to being generally accepted as a substitute for the horizontal supply
curve of earlier days.” But Reynolds’s prediction was premature. By the 1960s the
concept of monopsony had been relegated to discussions of company towns. Indeed,
in the preface to the second edition to her book, Robinson (1969) observed, “All this
had no effect. Perfect competition, supply and demand … and marginal products
still reign supreme in orthodox teaching.”
At the risk of following too closely in Reynolds’s footsteps, in this paper I will
try to make the case that the time has come to recognize that many—or even most—
firms have some  wage-setting power. Such a shift was made with respect to firm’s
price-setting power many decades ago. Economists now routinely accept that the
prices of products like gasoline, breakfast cereal, and ketchup are set with some
degree of market power, even in  online markets. In the past few years we may have
reached a tipping point for a similar transition in labor economics, driven by the
combination of new (or at least  post-1930) theoretical perspectives, newly available
data sources, and accumulating evidence on several different fron

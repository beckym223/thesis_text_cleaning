Note the following two implications of equations (1) and (2):

•

The sign of the tw

o effects depends on

R



−



1

. If

R



<



1

, then a decrease in

capital accumulation increases utility

. In other words, if the marginal product is

less than the growth rate (which here is equal to 0), an intergenerational transfer
has a positive effect on welfare in steady state.

•

The strength of the second ef

fect depends on the elasticity of substitution



η



. If

for example  η



=



∞



so the production function is linear and capital accumulation

has no effect on either wages or rates of return to capital, this second effect is equal to 0.
So far, I just replicated the analysis in Diamond.

19 Now I introduce uncertainty in

production, so the marginal product of capital is uncertain. If people are risk averse, the average safe rate will be less than the average marginal product of capital. The basic question becomes: what is the relevant rate we should look at for welfare purposesPut
loosely, is it the average marginal product of capital

ER

, or is it the a

verage

safe rate

ER

f  , or is it some other rate altogetherThe

model is the same as before, except for the introduction of uncertainty.

People born at time

t

ha

ve expected utility given by (I now need time subscripts

as the steady state is stochastic)

U

t   ≡  (1 − β) U ( C 1,t  )  + βEU  ( C 2,t+1  )  .

Their budget constraints are given by

C

1t   =  W  t   −  K t   − D ;  C  2t+1   =  R t+1   K t   + D  .

Production is given by a constant returns production function

Y

t   =  A t   F ( K t−1  , N)  ,

where

N



=



1

and

A

t    is stochastic. (The capital at time  t   reflects the sa ving of the

young at time

t



−



1

, thus the timing con

vention.)

At time

t

, the first-order condition for utility maximization is gi

ven by

(1 − β) U′ ( C 1,t  )  = β E  [ R t+1  U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ]  .

We can now define a shadow safe rate

R

t+1  f   , which must satisfy



R

t+1  f   E [U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ]  = E  [ R t+1  U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ]

Likewise, growth in real wage rates in India was at nearly eight percent per year
in this period. There has been much debate about poverty in India over this period.
While the data in Table 5 do not speak directly to that issue, workers in McDonald's
restaurants are not highly paid relative to other workers, even by Indian standards. It
is hard to imagine that the scale of growth these data display did not have consider
able effects on the welfare of Indian workers more generally.
Table 6 and the accompanying Figures 13-15 contain data on changes over the
recent period from 2007 to 2011 that reflects the current financial crisis and its after
math. The first column contains the McWage in 2011 relative to its value in 2007,
while columns 2 and 3 provide the ratios for the Big Mac price and the BMPH. The
clear message from Table 6 is that, with a couple of notable exceptions, real wage
rates have either fallen (sometimes quite sharply) or remained constant over this
period. These real wage declines have been associated with both nominal wage and
price increases, but the price increases have not been fully matched by correspond
ing nominal wage increases.
The two primary exceptions are Russia and China. The pace of real wage
increases in Russia is impressive, and much harder to attribute to the recovery from
the Russian financial crisis nearly a decade before. China's growth has slowed down
over this period to a rate that is about two-thirds of the growth rate in the precrisis
period. With these two exceptions, the previous decade's nearly universal real wage
growth in the developing countries has not been replicated in the most recent period.

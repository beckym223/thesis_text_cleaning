Here, pd t is the rental price of durables, as above. The unconstrained household's
demand for the goods component of consumption satisfies

(26) Py,tcyt = <t>pCttct

and similarly for constrained households. Total nondurable consumption is

(27) PyjCyJ = (/>PCj(Ct I" Ct).

Unconstrained households order their paths of composite consumption according
to the intertemporal utility function

(28) Ct

1 - l/a 9

where a is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

Constrained households' consumption is

(29) pCJct = Pytt{uyt - styt),

where u is the fraction of constrained households and st is the burden of interest and
debt repayments of constrained households as a fraction of output.

Consumption of durables services is

(30) PdA-i = (! ~ </>)PcA?t + Ct)

C. The Price of Output

I take the price of output, py t, to be an upward trend at rate 7r:

(31) Py,t = P(l ~ 7T)->.

D. Employment

As in the standard Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, all workers desire to
work a standard number of hours. The only source of variation in aggregate hours of
work arises from unemployment.

Hall (2009) gives a compact summary of the search-and-matching model whose

canon is Dale T. Mortensen and Christopher T. Pissarides (1994). My approach
generalizes wage determination relative to the Nash bargain in that paper. Also, I
simplify the treatment of labor-market dynamics by considering only the stochastic
equilibrium of labor turnover, which means that the employment rate n measures
the tightness of the labor market. The vacancy rate enters the picture only in fast
transitional dynamics of the matching process, which can be ignored in a quarterly
model without losing much. Thus the recruiting success rate is a function q(n) of the
employment rate. Success is higher when employment is lower.

90 percent requires a major fiscal consolidation and, if the fiscal consolidation cannot
be fully offset by expansionary monetary policy, an economic contraction. As
Giavazzi and Pagano, and Lorenzoni and Werning, have shown, other dimensions of debt and fiscal policy, such as the maturity of debt or the aggressiveness of the fiscal rule in response to higher interest rates, are likely to be more important than the level of debt itself, and help eliminate the bad equilibrium. To be more concrete, it may be that, rather than embarking on fiscal austerity if it cannot be fully offset by looser monetary policy, it is better to rely on an aggressive contingent fiscal rule to eliminate the bad equilibrium.
VI. Conclusions

In this lecture, I have looked at the fiscal and welfare costs of higher debt in an
economy where the safe interest rate is less than the growth rate. I have argued that this is a relevant empirical configuration, and indeed has been the norm rather than the exception in the United States in the past. I have argued that both the fiscal and welfare costs of debt may then be small, smaller than is generally taken as given in current policy discussions. I have considered a number of counterarguments, which are indeed valid, and may imply larger fiscal and welfare costs. The purpose of this lecture is most definitely not to argue for higher debt per se, but to allow for a richer discussion of debt policy and appropriate debt rules than is currently the case.

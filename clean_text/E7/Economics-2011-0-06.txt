II. The Overhang of Housing and Consumer Durables
Figure 4 shows the ratios of housing and consumer durables, on the one hand, and
business capital (plant and equipment), on the other hand, over the past 20 years.
Business capital was virtually constant as a fraction of GDP, and so was housing
and durables in the 1990s, but a conspicuous bulge in household capital occurred
in the 2000s. The economy reached the crisis with about 14 percent more housing
and durables in relation to GDP than normal. Almost all economic models?and the
historical performance of the US economy?agree on the principle that what goes
above normal will tend to return to normal. Thus the overhang of housing and consumer
durables pointed toward lower future spending in these categories, no matter
what happened to the economy.
I'll not say anything more about the fascinating topic of the causes of the splurge on
houses and cars and the rise and fall in housing prices. I just take the abnormal level
of household capital goods as a fact about the economy as of the end of 2008. Others
are working on the topic of the house-price bubble. Macroeconomists have built asset
price crashes into general-equilibrium models?Craig Burnside, Martin Eichenbaum,
and Sergio Rebelo (2010) is a recent example where beliefs about appreciation spread
among homeowners like an epidemic disease. See also Narayana Kocherlakota (2010)
and Alberto Martin and Jaume Ventura (2010). No view about the origins of bubbles or
crashes is yet firmly established.
III. Illiquid Households and Debt-Service Commitments
A significant fraction of American consumers appear to be at corners in their
intertemporal equilibria?they borrow as much as they can and hold almost no liquid
assets. I take a family as liquidity-constrained if its holdings of net liquid assets
are less than two months of income. Net liquid assets are the difference between

III. Empirical Evidence in the First Three Decades of Modern Labor Economics:
1965–1995
“Modern” labor economics began in the  mid-1960s with the release of individ-
ual microdata from the 1960 census (e.g., Cain 1966; Hanoch 1967; Bowen and
Finegan 1969), the Survey of Consumer Finances (e.g., Stafford 1968) and the
Survey of Economic Opportunity (e.g., Ashenfelter 1972). As noted by Stafford
(1986), these new datasets, along with  cross-sectional microdata from the Current
Population Surveys and longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
and the National Longitudinal Surveys, propelled research in the field for the next
few decades and shaped our current understanding of the labor market.
Considerations of employer  wage setting played little role in this stream of
research. One reason for this was the influence of economists at the University of
Chicago, who were at the forefront of the new “analytical” labor economics (Rees
1976), and strongly advocated for neoclassical modeling. Even more importantly,
the newly available micro datasets had almost no information on employers. Thus,
it was extremely convenient to frame the analysis in the setting described by Hicks
(1932), where individual employers are irrelevant.
There were a couple of exceptions to this general rule. One was the analysis
of wage setting under collective bargaining. Here, most analysts followed Lewis
(1963) in modeling a unionized sector where wages were pushed above the com-
petitive level, and a nonunion sector where wages were determined under perfect
competition. There was little attention to the role of  firm-specific factors, apart from
a small literature based on wage contracts (e.g., Hamermesh 1970; Riddell 1979;
Christofides, Swidinsky, and Wilton 1980) that eventually turned to the question
of how employment and wages are jointly determined under collective bargaining
(e.g., Brown and Ashenfelter 1986; Card 1986, 1990).
A second exception was the literature on quits, turnover, and the returns to senior -
ity. Pencavel (1972) and Parsons (1972) presented  multi-period models of employer
wage setting with a trade-off between wages and quit rates—foreshadowing the
dynamic monopsony literature discussed below. While the  wage-setting equations
in these papers are clearly interpretable in a monopsony framework, neither author
acknowledged any connection with Robinson, or noted that in a perfectly competi-
tive labor market the quit rate should rise to 100 percent if the wage is set below the
“market” rate.
A problem faced by both papers was the confusion surrounding Becker’s (1962)
analysis of  firm-specific human capital, which addressed what we now call the
problem of “ relationship-specific investments.”7 Many labor economists interpreted
Becker as saying that firms choose wages to reduce quits (e.g., Parsons 1972 and
Hashimoto 1981) assuming that quits are a smooth function of wages. This is equiv-
alent to monopsonistic wage setting.8
7 Crawford (1988) presents an elegant reformulation of Becker that clarifies the issues using modern terminol-
ogy. See also MacLeod and Malcomson (1993).
8 See Manning (2003) for more discussion. Donaldson and Eaton (1976) also noted some of the problems with
a simple interpretation of Becker’s model of wage setting with relationship investments.

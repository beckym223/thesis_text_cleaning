is impressive, especially in view of the simplicity with which it is possible to esti
mate TFP from wage-rate differences. Since the adjustment for capital/output ratios
plays such a small role in these calculations (see Hall and Jones 1999, Table 1), it is
apparent that McWage ratios are, by themselves, good shorthand measures of TFP
differences across countries.

Figure 9 displays the relation between the TFP measures contained in Table 4. This
figure shows where the wage-based measures of TFP are problematic. In countries
with very high minimum wage rates, like Australia and much of Western Europe, the
wage structure is altered and the McWage no longer serves as a measure of aggregate
output differences.12 Monopoly in the product market or monopsony in the labor mar
ket would also undermine the usefulness of wage rates for this purpose.13

VI. Comparing Changes in Real Wages

Table 5 and Figures 10,11, and 12 provide details on wage and pnce changes over
the period 2000-2007. Data were collected for a much more limited set of countries

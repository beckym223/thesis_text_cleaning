grain. The grain can be stored, but decays in storage by a factor 6. There is also
government debt, denominated in dollars. Its amount at the initial date t = 1 is B0,
and it is held by the initial old, who redeem it with the government, receiving in
return new one-period debt in the amount B] — R0B0. Since this new government
paper is worthless to the initial old, they attempt to sell it to the initial young, for
grain. The price level at date t is the rate at which grain trades for newly issued gov
ernment debt. This process repeats thereafter for t = 1,..., oo.

Formally, the generation born at t maximizes its lifetime utility U(CU, C2j+ 0 sub
ject to the constraints

(1) C„ + S, + y = 1

(2) c2,+1 = ^L + est

rf+I

(3) S, >0, B, > 0.

Because the government is doing nothing but rolling over the debt each period, the
market clearing condition is simply R,B, = Br+l. The government sets an arbitrary
value for R, each period. The first-order conditions for an agent in generation t,
assuming perfect foresight about next period's P, are

(4) dCx: Dx U(CU, C2,t+1) = A,

(5) c>C2: D2U(Cu, C2t+i) = n,+\

(6) dB,: iffi;>0

(7) dSX, = Q[i,+\, if S, > 0.

The B and S first order conditions tell us, as we would expect, that if agents are stor
ing grain and also buying debt, their returns must match, so that in that case

In order to get easily computed solutions that give us some insight into how the
model works, we assume R, is constant and

U(cu, C2,,+1) = logic,,) + log(C2f+1).

Then the Lagrange multipliers can be solved out to deliver

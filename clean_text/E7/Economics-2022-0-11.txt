end of the labor market, firms respond to  wage-setting choices by their competitors
(Derenoncourt et al. 2021). It therefore seems necessary to move beyond the “no
strategic interactions” case considered in several recent studies. Berger, Herkenhoff,
and Mongey (2021) have made some initial progress in this direction.
B. Who Should Study Wage SettingOnce
we accept that firms set wages, the analysis of wage setting becomes a part
of labor economics, just like the analysis of price setting is a part of IO. Right now,
much of the practical discussion of wage setting is done by  noneconomists. Human
resources departments at large corporations are often staffed by people with primary
training in social psychology or sociology. Most business schools have almost no
courses on wage setting, and few if any that feature standard economic ideas.
By insisting that “markets set wages,” labor economists ceded the field, and had
very little to say about questions like the design of online labor markets, or the
effects of  no-solicitation or  no-poaching agreements—other than that they should
not matter. We also distanced ourselves from other economists—particularly those
in IO—who were busy developing useful models of market power and strategic
decision making.
One of the most exciting developments in the field today is the evidence of labor
economists taking questions about wage setting seriously. This effort began with
Manning’s (2003) landmark book: I hope that the growing body of work since
then finds its way into the classroom and into the textbooks soon. I also expect this
work to lead to some  rethinking on policies such as minimum wages, the regulation
of trade unions, and  anti-trust (see Langella and Manning 2021, and Naidu and
Posner 2021). Perhaps we may even see a  reevaluation of the widespread belief that
excessive wages are the root cause of many economic problems. After all, if your
employer set your wage, it’s hard to believe that it’s too high.

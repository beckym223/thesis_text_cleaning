end of the labor market, firms respond to  wage-setting choices by their competitors 
(Derenoncourt et al. 2021). It therefore seems necessary to move beyond the “no 
strategic interactions” case considered in several recent studies. Berger, Herkenhoff, 
and Mongey (2021) have made some initial progress in this direction.
B. Who Should Study Wage Setting?
Once we accept that firms set wages, the analysis of wage setting becomes a part 
of labor economics, just like the analysis of price setting is a part of IO. Right now, 
much of the practical discussion of wage setting is done by  noneconomists. Human 
resources departments at large corporations are often staffed by people with primary 
training in social psychology or sociology. Most business schools have almost no 
courses on wage setting, and few if any that feature standard economic ideas.
By insisting that “markets set wages,” labor economists ceded the field, and had 
very little to say about questions like the design of online labor markets, or the 
effects of  no-solicitation or  no-poaching agreements—other than that they should 
not matter. We also distanced ourselves from other economists—particularly those 
in IO—who were busy developing useful models of market power and strategic 
decision making.
One of the most exciting developments in the field today is the evidence of labor 
economists taking questions about wage setting seriously. This effort began with 
Manning’s (2003) landmark book: I hope that the growing body of work since 
then finds its way into the classroom and into the textbooks soon. I also expect this 
work to lead to some  rethinking on policies such as minimum wages, the regulation 
of trade unions, and  anti-trust (see Langella and Manning 2021, and Naidu and 
Posner 2021). Perhaps we may even see a  reevaluation of the widespread belief that 
excessive wages are the root cause of many economic problems. After all, if your 
employer set your wage, it’s hard to believe that it’s too high.

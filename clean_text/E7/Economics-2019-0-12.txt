1950s, 1960s, or 1970s, is quite dramatic. But the figure also shows that a series
of bad shocks, such as happened in the 1980s, can increase the debt ratio to higher levels for a while.
Figure 6, which I believe is the more appropriate one, gives an even more optimis-
tic picture, where the debt ratio rarely would have increased, even in the
1980s: the

reason being the higher tax revenues associated with inflation during that period.
What these figures show is that, historically, debt rollovers would have been fea-
sible. Put another way, it shows that the fiscal cost of higher debt would have been small, if not zero. This is at striking variance with the current discussions of fiscal space, which all start from the premise that the interest rate is higher than the growth rate, implying a tax burden of the debt.
The fact that debt rollovers may be feasible (i.e., that they may not have a fiscal
cost) does not imply however that they are desirable (that they have no welfare cost). This is the topic taken up in the next two sections.Figure 6.

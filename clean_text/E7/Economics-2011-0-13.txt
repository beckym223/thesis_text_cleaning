Figure 10 provides further confirmation of a substantial and persistent increase
in household rationing from the financial crisis. It shows an index from Google
Insights of queries for the term "withdrawal penalty." The logic is that households
suffering from income interruptions, who might normally have borrowing opportunities
 or other ways to deal with the need to fund continuing normal consumption,
 turn to expensive alternatives such as 40IK withdrawals that are subject to a
penalty tax. The index measures, in arbitrary units, the share of all search queries
on Google for this term. The index jumped up in late 2008 and has remained high
ever since.
Rationing through the application of lending standards enters the model in the
same way as agency frictions. Borrowers behave as if credit were more costly than
the interest rate they pay for the amounts they are actually allowed to borrow. The
data in Figure 6 through Figure 10 suggest that agency frictions, default costs,
and rationing all worsened during the crisis and have remained at levels close to
their peaks during the crisis. I combine all of these factors into the wedge discussed
 earlier. Although the evidence seems strong that the wedge increased and
has remained high, I have not found a basis for quantifying its rate. Rather, I will
demonstrate that rates in a reasonable range have powerful negative effects on output
 and employment.

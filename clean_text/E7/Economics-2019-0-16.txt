Now consider a small increase in  D   on utility at time  t  :

d

U

t   =  [−  (1 − β) U′ ( C 1,t  )  + βEU′  ( C 2,t+1  ) ] dD

+

[ (1 − β) U′ ( C 1,t  )  d W t   + β K t   E [U′ ( C 2,t+1  )  d R t+1  ] ]  .
As before, the first term in brackets, call it

d

U

at   , reflects the partial equilibrium,

direct, effect of the transfer, the second term, call it

d

U

bt   , reflects the general equilibrium

effect of the transfer through the change in wages and rates of return to capital.
Take the first term, the effect of debt on utility given prices. Using the first-order
condition gives

d

U

at   =  [− βE  [ R t+1  U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ]  + βE  [U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ] ]  dD .
So, using the definition of the safe rate:

(3)

d

U

at   = β (1 −  R  t+1  f  ) EU′ ( C 2,t+1  ) dD .

So, to determine the sign ef

fect of the transfer on welfare through this first channel,

the relevant rate is indeed the safe rate. In any period in which

R

t+1  f    is less than

1, the transfer is welf

are improving.

The reason why the safe rate is what matters is straightforward and important:
the safe rate is, in effect, the risk-adjusted rate of return on capital.20 The intergenerational
transfer gives people a higher rate of return than the risk-adjusted rate of
return on capital.

Take the second term, the effect of the transfer on utility through prices:
d

U

bt   =  (1 − β) U′ ( C 1,t  )  d W t   + βE  [U′ ( C 2,t+1  )  K t   d R t+1  ]  .
Or using the factor price frontier relation:

d

U

bt   =  (−1 − β) U′ ( C 1,t  )   K t−1   d R t   + βE  [U′ ( C 2,t+1  )  K t   d R t+1  ]  .
In general, this term will depend both on

d

K

t−1    (which affects  d W t   ) and on  d  K  t

(which affects

d

R

t+1   ). If we evaluate it at   K  t   =  K t−1   = K   and  d  K  t   = d K  t+1
=

dK

, it can be re

written, using the same steps as in the certainty case, as

(4)

d

U

bt   =  [β (1/η) α] E [ ( R t+1   −    R t+1   _  R t    ) U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ]   R t    dK ,
or

(5)



d

U

bt   =  [β (1/η) α] E [ R t+1  U′ ( C 2,t+1  ) ]  ( R t   − 1)  dK .

Thus, the relevant rate in assessing the sign of the welfare effect of the transfer
through this second term is the risky rate, the marginal product of capital. If
R

t    is

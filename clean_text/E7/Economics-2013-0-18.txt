These first order conditions look complicated, but when 9 = 0, so that there is no
cost to inflation, they collapse to a surprisingly simple solution. To keep things
neat, we assume /3p = 1. From the b and R FOCs and the Fisher equation (31) we
can derive

(37) b,X, = n,p.

Substituting into the v first order condition, we arrive at

(38) {y, - 1) = (—A, + \,-\)Rt-\bt_x = (r, - T,_x)Rt_ib,_

If 9 = 0, this lets us conclude that r, = rf_j, so long as Rt_\ and b,_l are both posi
tive. With T, constant and g, exogenous and stochastic, (31) is an unstable equation.
Feasibility (b > 0) and transversality (b, —> oo while future r's are constant cannot
be optimal) imply that b must not explode. This implies that we can solve the budget
constraint (32) forward to produce

In the special case where g is i.i.d., b is constant, b is maintained at these stability
consistent values by fluctuations in u„ the inverse inflation rate, that offset the effects
of g on the real value of the debt.

So far, we have derived an analogue in this simple model of the Lucas-Stokey
result, by setting 9 = 0. We can also consider 9 = oo, i.e., a case where the price
level is kept constant and only real government debt exists. Then we drop the v first
order condition, because v is no longer freely chosen, and use the fact that vt = 1.
Then the b first order condition lets us conclude that E,rt+l = r„ and we are back
to Barro's (1979) conclusion (since we are now back to Barro's model, which had
only real debt).

The cases of most interest, though, are those with 0 < 9 < oo. For these cases,
we want to contrast this version of the model with one in which government debt is
not only nominal, but long term. We will consider the extreme case of consol debt,
which pays a stream of one "dollar" per period forever, never returning principal.
The number of consols held by the public is A, and the price, in dollars, of a consol
is Q,. (So 1/(2, is the long term interest rate). Then the Fisher equation requires that
the expected one-period yield on a consol be equal to p, i.e.,

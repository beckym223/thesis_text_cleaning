poor African countries where, if they can be found at all, are only available in a few specialty
stores in the main city. The specifications in the list make this seem plausible. For example,
among the items successfully priced in Cameroon were (a) frozen shrimp (Fish basic head

Listing such specifications is not the same thing as establishing that they are responsible for
overstating prices or price levels in some poor countries, let alone that they are responsible for
overstating measured income inequality in the world. One way to look more deeply is to exam
ine the bilateral price indexes that go into the multilateral indexes. In this context, the T?rnqvist
index, which can be decomposed into the contributions from each good, is more useful than the
Fisher index, which it closely approximates. If we denote by s^ the budget share of good n in
country c, the log of the bilateral T?rnqvist index for country c with country 1 as base is

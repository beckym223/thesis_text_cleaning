normal period 2000-2007 and compare that with the path they have taken since then
in the aftermath of the world's recent financial crisis, 2007-2011.
II. Historical Measures of Real Wages
Our long-run conception of economic progress is based in our understanding of
worker wages and welfare over long periods. For example, measuring worker wel
fare before, during, and after the industrial revolution sets the background for our
understanding of the massive change in economic welfare that resulted. That, in
turn, provides some perspective on how today's developing countries may evolve
in the future. In the last decade a lively set of analyses by economic historians has
shed some new light on these old questions.
A. Before the Industrial Revolution
Table 1 provides an example of the problems of constructing real wage measures
and also some perspective on an early period prior to the Industrial Revolution.
Comparing wage rates between Canton Province in China and London in England
in 1704 provides a benchmark for more modern comparisons.
The data for the calculations in the table are from the records of a member of
the East India Company in the 18th century, and have been assembled by Allen
(2004). Wages and prices are measured using the East India Company exchange
rates, which apparently closely mirror exchange rates measured in units of silver, a
common currency in 1700. The results in Table 1 may come as a surprise to some.
First, as the first column of the table indicates, the nominal wage rate in London
was between three and four times higher than in Canton. Second, it is also appar
ent from the table that nominal prices were generally, but not universally, higher in

Both reasons had emotional resonance as the affect heuristic would predict, in the
wake of the war, the influenza epidemic, and other factors.

There we have it: a possible narrative-based unconventional explanation - or at
least partial explanation - for the Depression of 1920-1921: substantially a consumer
boycott against imagined profiteers, based on narratives that made them villains,
abetted by a sense of possible personal opportunity to postpone buying, or

sense of revenge against the profiteers by outsmarting them, in the presence of an
affect heuristic event driven by other emotion-laden narratives (connected to the
World War, the Communist revolution, the influenza epidemic, the race riots, the
Big Red Scare, and the oil shock). Betting on falling consumer prices is a speculative
bet that can come to an end just as quickly as opinions about the stock market
change, and in this case, the end came in a little over a year.

IX. Narratives during the Great Depression of the 1930s

The Great Depression (which I describe as the whole period 1929 to 1941,

including the two NBER contractions) is the most long-term severe episode of
macroeconomic malfunction in world history. And yet we have no received theory
as to why it had such magnitude and duration.

Some theories of the extreme persistence of the Great Depression not relying on
narratives seem plausible. Cole and Ohanian (2004) argued that a policy intended
to combat the Depression in the United States, embodied in the 1934 National
Industrial Recovery Act, which imposed "codes of fair competition," prolonged the
Depression. The Act made it easier for businesses to form cartels and more difficult
for them to cut wages. Although the Supreme Court declared the Act unconstitu

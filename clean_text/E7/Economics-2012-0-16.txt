1 â€” a, which has the interpretation as the fraction of a Big Mac that is tradable,
is about 0.6.10

For the less developed countries there is a clear tendency for the PPP-adjusted
McWage to be greater that the BMPH in Figure 6. There are many possible interpre
tations of this, but one obvious possibility is that the Big Mac is a more expensive
(i.e., tradable) bundle of goods than is appropriate for indexation of wage rates in
very low-wage countries. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the BMPH does
not depend on any exchange rate adjustment, so that distortions in exchange rates
do not affect its calculation.

Figure 8 provides a final comparison of McWages with output per man hour for
countries where this is available. These variables are also highly correlated, but there
is a very noticeable tendency for the McWage to be elevated relative to output per
man hour in countries with high minimum wages. This is an important issue to con
sider when using wage rates to provide indirect measures of aggregate productivity.

Table 3 provides a basic cross-section of data for 2007 on prices and wages from
McDonald's restaurants. In order to create a manageable, readable table I have
aggregated the more than 60 countries for which there are data into a group of

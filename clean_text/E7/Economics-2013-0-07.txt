surpluses, its debt will have non-zero real value. But if debt is real and the country
finds itself unable to maintain primary surpluses above its predetermined real debt
service commitment, it must default, even if in absolute terms it is running substan
tial primary surpluses.
Nominal Debt is a Cushion, Like Equity.â€”In a deterministic steady state, inves
tors will insist on nominal interest rates high enough to compensate for inflation's
effect on the real value of their debt holdings. Real returns on government debt will
be the same whether it is nominal or real. But if nominal interest rates fall after the
date of issue of long-term nominal debt with a fixed coupon rate, the market value
of the debt will rise, providing the debt holder with an unanticipated higher return.
If inflation occurs at a higher than expected rate, the real value of nominal debt,
whatever its maturity, suffers an unanticipated decline. These mechanisms can cush
ion the impact of unexpected changes in the fiscal situation. We live in a stochastic
world, and surprises in returns on government debt from these two mechanisms
are substantial. Figure 1 shows a time series of surprise gains and losses on US
government debt as a fraction of GDP.6 The surprise gains and losses relative to
GDP have been of the same order of magnitude as year to year fluctuations in the

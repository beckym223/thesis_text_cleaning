Without loss of generality, the wage paid to the worker can be decomposed into
two parts, corresponding to a two-part pricing contract (the decomposition is conceptual,
not a suggestion that actual compensation practices take this form). The worker
pays a present value Jt to the employer for the privilege of holding the job and then
receives a flow of compensation equal to the worker's marginal revenue product.
The cost of recruiting (holding a vacancy open) is 7 per period, taken to be constant
in output terms. The zero-profit condition for recruiting equates the expected
benefit of recruiting to its cost:

(32) q(nt)Jt = py^.

Thus unemployment rises if J falls. I take

(33) Jt = J(mt),

an increasing function of the marginal revenue product of labor, mn so that, in slack
markets with high xt and thus lower mt, a worker pays less for a job. I solve for
employment as a function of mt and take the function as constant-elastic:

(34) n< = ~n\!%)

where the elasticity ip is positive, m is the normal level of mt which I take to be its
full-employment value,

\ l-a

(35) m = apyt

Solving,

(36) nt = nx^-^.

The contraction in 7 when the marginal product of labor falls can be interpreted as
wage stickiness, or, more accurately, compensation stickiness. If total compensation
is sticky and the net benefit falls, then J must fall, because / is the present value of
the difference between the net benefit and the worker's actual compensation.
The separation or turnover rate is a fraction v of employment, a constant. The cost
of filling a vacancy, 7/g, is 14 percent of a quarter's earnings, according to Jose A.
Silva and Manuel Toledo (2008).

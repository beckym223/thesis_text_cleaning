1929, and it may not in fact have been stronger, despite the appearance in Figure 6,
given the limitations of word counts as measures of narratives.

Where did the 1929 crash narrative get such strength? Part of the strength in 1929
seems to come from certain moralizing. The fact that the 1920s had been not only a
time of economic superabundance but also of sexual liberation - a morality viewed
negatively by some, though they were unable to make a case against it until the new
story of the stock market crash appeared.

Sermons preached on the Sunday after the crash, November 3, 2016, as reported
in newspapers the following day, took great note of the crash, and attributed it to
excesses, moral and spiritual. The sermons helped frame a narrative of a sort of
day-of-judgment on the "Roaring Twenties." (Google Ngrams shows that the term
"Roaring Twenties" was rarely used in the 1920s: the usage of that term first became
substantial in the 1930s and follows a hump-shaped pattern roughly like the infectives
plot in Figure 2, not peaking until the early 1960s.)

It helps to listen to these people's narratives from the time of the Great Depression

all the time, we lost our sense of perspective. We spent fabulous

less than 1, the implicit transfer due to the change in input prices increases utility. If
R
t    is greater than 1, the implicit transfer decreases utility.
The reason why it is the risky rate that matters is simple. Capital yields a rate of
return
R
t+1   . The change in prices due to the decrease in capital represents an implicit
transfer with rate of return   R
t+1  / R t   . Thus, whether the implicit transfer increases or
decreases utility depends on whether
R
t    is less or greater than 1.
Putting the two sets of results together: if the safe rate is less than 1, and
the risky rate is greater than 1 (the configuration that appears to be relevant
today) the two terms now work in opposite directions. The first term implies that an
increase in debt increases welfare. The second term implies that an increase in debt instead decreases welfare. Both rates are thus relevant.
To get a sense of relative magnitudes of the two effects, and therefore which one
is likely to dominate, the following approximation is useful. Evaluate the two terms at the average values of the safe and the risky rates, to get



sign
[ (1 − E R    f  )  −  (1/η) αE R   f  (− dK/dD)  (ER − 1) ]
where, from the accumulation equation, we ha
ve the following approximation:21
dK /dD  ≈  −    1 ___________   1 − βα (1/η) ER   .
Note that, if the production is linear
, and so
η

=

∞
, the second term in equation
(
6) is equal to 0, and the only rate that matters is
E
R
f  . Thus, if  E  R    f   is less than 1, a
higher transfer increases welfare. As the elasticity of substitution becomes smaller,
the price effect becomes stronger, and, eventually, the welfare effect changes sign and becomes negative.
In the Cobb-Douglas case, using the fact that
ER

≈
(1 − α) / (αβ)  , (the approx-
imation comes from ignoring Jensen’s inequality) the equation reduces to the sim-
pler formula:

Suppose that the average annual safe rate is 2 percent lower than the growth rate,
so that
E
R
f  , the gross rate of return over a unit period, say 25 years, is   0.98    25  = 0.6  ,
then the welfare effect of a small increase in the transfer is positive if
ER

is less than

to make one alert to the possibilities of the social science of totalitarian-
ism which have become so threatening.
I have just been to Chicago (A.E.A.) and have come away disappointed.
Too many papers on legislation-really a small branch of the Bar As-
sociation. Not a single comment from the floor on papers dealing with
theory, suggesting that no one could understand highly mathematical
papers read from the floor. Douglas gave a rather masterly presidential
address.
I have been struck by the interest in aggregates and averages and the
consequent decline of interest in reforms. The new interest in mass ma-
nipulation seems to be taking the zeal out of interest in reforms. In other
words, reforms are now trivial matters and the concern is with legislation
and administrative detail.
The great problem in the American Economic Association is to check this
tendency to splinter groups and to split up economic knowledge into little
groups with vested interests of their own in publications, and in meetings,
joint or otherwise. The prospect of emphasizing a theoretical, universal,
and all-inclusive approach is, in consequence, very difficult.

I could easily imagine Harold Innis saying to me the words once
used by the late Robert Warren: "No economist is worth a damn if he
doesn't have integrity."
Whatever the influence of Harold Innis effectively touched, there
was quality as a result.

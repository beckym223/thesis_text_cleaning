free and frequent elections, and our civil liberties of freedom of

perhaps because of it-our economy remains the outstanding expression
of private enterprise in the world of today. There is a deep-rooted faith
in the system and a widespread determination that it be preserved. It is
doubtful whether prophecies of doom are any better founded for the
future than they have been in the past. There appears to be good
promise that freedom and authority can be so harmonized as to promote
economic well-being without sacrifice of essential values.

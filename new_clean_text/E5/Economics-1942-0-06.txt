in the face of a substantial rise in the national income and of large in-
creases in taxes. Deficit financing is too new to be well understood. We
are still in the stage of trying to find out why the course of events does
not correspond to the theoretical models. Nevertheless, it is possible to
see why deficit financing at the best is an unreliable device and why it
may do little good and may even impede an expansion of privately pro-
duced income. Since the saving function is considerably more elastic
relative to national income than the investment function, a relatively
large deficit is necessary to raise the national income by a small amount.
But a deficit may cause the investment function to shift to the left,
especially if it arouses the expectation of higher taxes and if the govern-
ment has manifested a strong propensity to tax profits. In this event, all
or nearly all of the stimulus of the deficit may be canceled. When

A comparison of 1926 and 1937 is of interest. Output per man-hour in manufacturing in
1937 was apparently 33.2 per cent above 1926, hourly earnings 22.4 per cent above 1926.
Finished goods were slightly higher relative to raw materials than in 1926. Nevertheless,
non-financial corporations made profits of only 3.8 billion dollars on sales of 108.4 billion
dollars in 1937, as against profits of 5.8 billion dollars on sales of 106.2 billion dollars in
1926 a margin of 3.54 cents per dollar of sales in 1937 and of 5.44 cents in 1926.
8 Satisfactory information on the saving function is virtually impossible to obtain because
the relation of consumption to income payments has been affected in recent years by
changes in taxes and other conditions. These changes may or may not be permanent. Further
changes appear to be ahead. At any rate, they indicate that attempts to deduce the saving
function from time series are likely to have little significance for the future. Such in-
formation as is available indicates that in the range between a national income of 60
billion dollars and 80 billion dollars there is an increase of about 40 cents in saving for
one dollar increase in income. Hence, a persistent deficit (or an increase in investment) of
4 billion dollars is necessary to raise the national income by about 10 billion dollars. If
the persistence of the deficit were to produce an unfavorable shift in the investment function
sufficient to cut private investment from 7 billion dollars to 5.25 billion dollars (or 25 per
cent) at a national income of 70 billion dollars, almost half the benefit of the deficit
would be lost. A shift of even greater magnitude in the investment function might easily
be produced by expectations of higher taxes. During the last decade deficits have been
working most of the time against a sharply declining marginal propensity to spend or
invest additional income, as the drop in the velocity of bank deposits outside New York
from 28.0 in 1933 to 22.6 in 1939 and 21.6 in 1940 plainly indicates. Of course, the drop
in the marginal propensity to spend must be attributed to a variety of causes, but one of

"Lift up your sights; extend your range." With these words my

response to his exhortation, I wish to open up with you a large subject
that is not merely of deep concern to American economists now. It

targets of our aim are balloons that invite puncturing-loose ideas and
vague phrases that befog thinking, slogans that masquerade as prin-

current wartime problems, those of the war-peace transition, or the

tions or potentialities—whether we stop with description and analysis
or seek to formulate policy and set up new institutions-whether we

content of living as I view them.

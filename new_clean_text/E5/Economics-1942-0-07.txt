neither rising national income nor rising tax rates reduced the deficit,
who could avoid concluding that substantially higher taxes were ahead,
and that, in view of the record, they might fall in substantial measure
on profits?
To the influence of the deficit in producing an unfavorable shift in
the investment function must be added tax changes well designed to
discourage innovations and experimentation and to reduce the attractiveness
of risky ventures. Between 1929 and 1936, the effective rate of
the corporate income tax was virtually doubled. It is no answer to say
that the tax is eventually shifted, because it is passed on only by restricting
the volume of investment. And since corporate profits are
produced in a large measure by innovation and experimentation, doubling
the tax on corporate profits amounted to doubling the tax on innovation
and experimentation.
Some changes in tax laws were especially well designed to penalize
chance-taking. The loss carry-over provision in the corporate income
tax was limited to one year in 1932, abolished in 1933, and not restored
until 1938. Capital losses, which had been fully deductible up to 1932,
were deductible only to a very restricted degree throughout the entire
critical period between 1932 and 1938.
Similar changes on an even more drastic scale were made in individual
income tax rates. Until 1932, the highest surtax rate was 20
per cent, applicable on incomes over $100,000. In 1932 surtaxes were
greatly raised. They were raised again in 1934 and 1936. Dividends
from corporations were made subject to the normal tax in 1936. By
1938, the normal tax and surtax took 35 per cent of additional income
immediately above $50,000; 51 per cent immediately above $74,000;
and 62 per cent immediately above $100,000. How drastically tax increases
reduced the marginal returns on investments in equities by the
persons who did the most saving is illustrated by the fact that by 1938
a man with an income of $50,000 would need a yield of 8 per cent
before his tax to obtain a return of 5.4 per cent. At the same time, the
capital loss provisions of the income tax were modified to narrow greatly
the opportunity to deduct capital losses. 10 In other words, the govern-

them seems to have been a conjunction of persistent deficits with a disposition to increase
those taxes which must directly limit the marginal efficiency of capital.
8 The base rate, which was 11 per cent in 1929, was raised to 12 per cent in 1930 and
13.75 per cent in 1932. The consolidated return was abolished for all corporations except
railroads in 1934, intercorporate dividends were taxed in 1935, a tax on undistributed profits
was added in 1936. Other changes which increased the effective burden, such as abolition of
the loss carry-over and restriction on credits for capital losses, are discussed below. The
corporate income tax was further increased by substantial additions to the base rates in 1938
and 1939, not to mention the subsequent increases required by the defense program,

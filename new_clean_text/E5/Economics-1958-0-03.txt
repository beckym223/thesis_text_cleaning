We in the West are proud-and justly proud of our free enterprise
economic system. Nonetheless, if you look for the kind of rounded
description and explanation of this type of system that the proverbial
man-from-Mars would need in order to understand in broad terms
what it is and how it works, you will not find one. I know of no pub-
lished explanation that does not leave important gaps and does not
badly need to have a number of qualifications attached to it.
Such descriptions and explanations of the free enterprise way of
organizing economic activity as we have are to be found chiefly in
connection with statements of principles of economics in general in-
troductory texts and texts on intermediate theory. These statements
commonly tell only a part of the story of free enterprise and a rather
misleading part at that. The aspects of a free-enterprise economy that
they typically select for consideration can fairly be characterized as
mechanisms, aspects that lend themselves to the techniques of model
analysis. And they slight what may be called the organic aspects of a
private-enterprise economy, particularly those aspects that reflect
changes in legal and economic institutions, and those like the master-
servant relationship that are not easily treated in the terms of an
individualistic ideology. I do not mean to say that most introductory
and intermediate theory texts neglect these organic aspects entirely;
only that consideration of them is often very scanty and is quite com-
monly put in a separate chapter rather than made a part of the ex-
planation of the private enterprise way of organizing economic activity.
But such scantiness and separateness of treatment can be an extremely
serious fault, particularly when one is concerned with the public-policy
implications of a statement of principles of economics.

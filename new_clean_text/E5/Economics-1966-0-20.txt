capita, probably still close to 5.5 in 2010, would continue to decline
until there would hardly be space even for our national flower, the concrete
cloverleaf. Aesthetic considerations of all sorts would be
swamped by masses instead of by costs masquerading as pseudo-utility
as at present. Even in the absence of strepitous poverty-mongers many
would be conscious of being poor.
An even worse prospect obtains in the world at large. Between 1960
and 2000, according to United Nations estimates, world population
will grow nearly twice as fast as in 1920-60-around 113 per cent to
between 6 and 7 billion. The proportion in the developed world will
fall to around 22 per cent, since its numbers will grow only 61 per
cent, or but two-fifths as fast as the population of the underdeveloped
world which is expected to increase about 151 per cent. Should world
population continue to grow about 2 per cent per year it would number
16-18 billion by 2050 and 43-50 billion by 2100. Even if it should proceed
only 1.5 per cent per year it would number 13-15 billion by 2050
and 26-31 billion by 2100. Acres of all sorts per capita, still about 4.7
to 5.5 in 2000, will then have fallen to 0.6-1.25 by 2100, and close to
one-half of this amount will be unfit for habitation except by Lower
Slobbovians. Man will have become essentially spaceless in a space
age, unless competition for living space should accidentally transform
the "ultimate deterrent" into the "ultimate detergent" and, as D. M.
Heer estimates (in his After Nuclear Attack), destroy perhaps 30 per
cent of the population, mostly in heavily urbanized areas.
Given growth of the order suggested as likely in the absence of concerted
efforts to limit numbers, food shortages would eventually develop
despite schemes for deriving protein from coal and petroleum as
well as subsistence from algae and other crude organic matter, or for
supporting a man on 20 well-cultivated square meters of soil. First,
cultivable land is limited, though only about 7 per cent is used for nonfood
crops, mainly fibers. In 1964 arable and permanent-crop land totaled
about 3.6 billion acres; land in permanent meadows and pasture,
about 6.2 billion acres; and land in forest, about 10 billion acres. Just
how much land in the two latter categories is convertible into crop land
is indeterminate, though subject to exaggeration. It depends upon technology,
upon mastery of cultivation in the tropics and in droughty and
cold regions, upon land clearing and development, often a costly process,
and upon adequacy of the water supply. From the gross amount
of land so converted must be subtracted land blotted out of agriculture
by creeping concrete, construction, city growth, etc., which in the
United States has amounted to one-half acre or more per inhabitant
added to the urban population.
Second, though average yield per acre could prove capable of 300 or

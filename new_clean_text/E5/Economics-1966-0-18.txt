underdeveloped world. The pressure of numbers upon family resources
generated by the decline of infant and child mortality has not yet
widely reduced births per mother. Governments not only show little
awareness of the urgency of the population problem; they even cushion
the incidence of child-rearing costs on responsible parents. The
Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, together with individual
countries, has sanctioned making contraceptive assistance internationally
available, but governments have provided little incentive
thereto [36].
The economic implications of United Nations studies of fertility and
population growth are at least fourfold. First, for a number of decades
population growth will absorb large amounts of physical and personal
capital that might otherwise have been used to elevate per capita
income. For example, ceteris paribus, per capita income can grow at
least one percentage point more per year, given a zero instead of a
two-per-cent-per-year rate of population growth. Second, little explanatory
insight is provided by economic models which merely suggest
that income will permanently outstrip numbers, but which are unequipped
with feedback mechanisms that produce at least limited downward
movements of fertility. It is necessary to show that movements
of income generate even greater relative demands for present and future
goods, services, and leisure; that elasticity of consumption expectations
exceeds elasticity of income expectations. Then, if the standard
of life rose ratchet-like, but always guarded against decline by pawllike
acquired tastes, one might count upon the retention of internalized
standards. Third, the apparent existence of a set of interrelated thresholds
suggests that international differences in shorter-run fertilityaffecting
constants are dissipatable through subjection to socioeconomic
solvents. Fourth, even though these parametrical differences
exist, it is certain that fertility can be greatly reduced, given availability
of contraceptives, if having more than a stipulated number of children,
say three, is economically penalized instead of subsidized as at
present. That it would pay the governments of underdeveloped countries
to reward those who curb their fertility has been demonstrated by
Stephen Enke who estimates one dollar thus spent to be worth about
$100 of other forms of aid [17].
III. The Future
Technology, prudence, and reason could generate a bright future.
That it will be bright, however, is questionable, given an unfettered
stork, together with continuing escalation of submarginal man in a
world of Freudian irresponsibility and distribution according to alleged

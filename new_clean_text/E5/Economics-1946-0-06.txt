procedures, has disclosed serious gaps in public policy and need for
supplementary enactments to facilitate the adjustment of labor
disputes. Finally, reliance upon public planning, for the purpose of
stabilizing economic activity, eliminating mass unemployment, furthering
the full use of productive resources, and increasing the flow of real
income, demands at every turn incisive exploration of both existing and
proposed governmental policies and practices.

In all these spheres, and in many others, there is manifest need for
focusing informed economic opinion upon the policy problems involved;
and in light of the great diversities of view that appear to prevail among
economists, methods and procedures are being developed by the
American Economic Association for co√∂perative definition of areas of
agreement and disagreement, so that professional knowledge and insight
and understanding may exert their appropriate influence in fashioning
the character of the institutions and arrangements which condition or
govern economic behavior.

Nor is this concern with policy problems either a new development
or a mere reflection of the special interests of particular programbuilders.
The American Economic Association was organized in 1885,
after a modest start had already been made, chiefly by the states, in
the field of public control of economic activity. It was born immediately
before government regulation, apart from tariff policy, first emerged
on a national basis through the adoption of the act to Regulate Commerce
in 1887 and the Sherman Anti-Trust act in 1890. In these
circumstances, and in view of the generally recognized scope of modern
political economy, it has been within the tradition of the Association
from the beginning to be concerned with the nature and purposes and
effects of government intervention in economic matters, not only with
a view to achieving better understanding of the functioning of the
economic order, but also in the hope at least, so frequently frustrated
in the classic case of the tariff, that informed opinion might provide
some measure of guidance in the evolution of public policy.
As long as governmental activity confined itself for the most part to
imposing piecemeal restraints and special obligations upon particular
aspects or segments of business enterprise, for the purpose of eliminating
or mitigating specific abuses, policy questions were largely
investigated by small groups of economists, acting within limited
spheres, as mere incidents to the adequate cultivation of their respective
specialties. This approach prevailed even in connection with the
comprehensive affirmative controls over rates, service, finance, and
related matters which were gradually developed in the public service

a The Farm Income Situation, U.S.D.A., October 31, 1955. Table 3, Net Income from farm-
ing, including farm wages, plus incomes of members of farm households from all outside
sources work off the farm, interest and dividends, social security, pensions, rents, etc. For
1940-54 only; the earlier estimates are compilations from several sources.

importantly in public discussion is the fact that, even since 1950, it
appears to be only slightly more than half the nonfarm. It is highly
important, therefore, to recognize fully that the two series thus con-
structed cannot be compared directly as they are, for the following
reasons:
1. One-tenth of the farm income is nonmoney income-farm-product
food and fuel and use of farm dwelling-valued at the farm. If a com-
parison with nonfarm income is to be made, these items must be
valued on a common basis, and the nonfarm basis will be best in this
case. This would probably increase the farm income by $700 per farm
since 1950, or $150 per capita. The best way to handle this particular
item is to figure what it would cost a city family to buy in the city the
equivalent of what goods and services the farm family gets from and
with the farm, subtract this from total city income, and compare the
residue with the cash income of the farm family. Figured this way,
the $150 would be increased considerably.
2. The farm family has a larger fraction of nonworking children to
support. More children are born to farm than to urban families, and
large numbers of farm youth migrate to the cities almost at the be-
ginning of their working years. Adjustments for this would bring farm
and nonfarm per capita incomes at least $100 nearer together.

of this distress housing, building construction in the period 1934 to
1937 would undoubtedly have been two to three times the rate which
prevailed. Since housing has always been the most important single outlet
for investment-seeking funds, the persistence of the depression in
housing was a main deterrent to recovery.³
But conditions of a more permanent nature have influenced the recovery.
The depression produced, or at least greatly accelerated, shifts
in economic and political power which are likely to be permanent and
it enormously stimulated the making of economic policy by the government.
These shifts in power and changes in public policy not only
affected recovery from the depression, but altered the long-run problem
of giving employment. It is important to examine their influence.

On the whole, the shift in economic and political power impeded recovery.
It did this in three principal ways. In the first place, the very
fact that a great shift in power was going on created uncertainty concerning
the long-term yield on capital and hence created an abnormal
preference for short-term production plans. In this way, uncertainty
narrowed investment opportunity and reduced temporarily the marginal
return on capital.6
In the second place, the shift in economic power altered in many
plants the control of managements over labor costs and increased the
difficulty of converting a rise of output into profits. It is instructive to
compare the revival of profits after 1934 with the revival after 1921—
two years in which national income was about 50 billion dollars. In
1921, non-financial corporations had a deficit of 355 million dollars,
in contrast with a profit of 884 million dollars in 1934. Between 1921
and 1923, a rise of the national income of 17.2 billion dollars to a level
of 70 billion dollars produced a 5.5 billion-dollar gain in the profits of
non-financial corporations. Between 1934 and 1937, a slightly larger


#### Split:
5 Part of the difficulties in housing must be attributed to unsatisfactory financial instruments,
particularly short-term second mortgages.
6 The extent to which the shifting of economic power and the imposition of new responsibilities
upon business caused short-term plans to be preferred to long-term plans is
roughly indicated by comparing for the two periods 1922-29 and 1933-39 expenditures
on equipment in relation to expenditures on plant. Since expenditures on equipment are
in large measure for replacement and expenditures on plant are in the main for the
enlargement of capacity, the change in the relation between the two roughly illustrates
the change in the importance of expenditures on long-run plans in relation to expenditures
on current needs. Between 1922 and 1929, 81.3 cents were spent by business enterprises
on plant for every dollar spent on equipment; between 1933 and 1939, only 44.5
cents were spent on plant for every dollar spent on equipment. Between 1922 and 1929,
expenditures on plant were 29,774 million dollars and on equipment 36,626 million
dollars; between 1933 and 1939, expenditures on plant were 10,850 million dollars and
on equipment 24,155 million dollars.

capitalists have always been an important dynamic influence in the
economy.* The bank failures and other special circumstances were also
largely responsible for the great amount of distress housing which hung
over the market until 1937. This prolonged the depression in residential
building long after the rest of the economy had revived. In the absence

* Some indirect evidence of the effect of the depression upon local capitalists is
provided by the income tax returns. For example, if one compares the volume of income
after taxes in 1931 and 1935, two years in which the national income was about 55
billion dollars, one finds that incomes of $25,000 or more in the former year totaled
1.9 billion dollars, and in the latter, 1.5 billion dollars, or 21.9 per cent less. (Imre de
Vegh, "Savings, Investment, and Consumption," Am. Econ. Rev., Suppl., vol. xxx,
Feb., 1941, p. 238.) These figures do not allow for capital gains and losses. Since the
year 1931 was one in which capital losses were large, the realized incomes of over
$25,000 before capital losses in 1931 were undoubtedly considerably more than 1.9 billion
dollars.
An impediment to recovery after 1933 that has been neglected is the scarcity of
business savings. The principal source of venture capital always has been the plowed-back
earnings of business enterprises. These have always been the spearhead of expansion, the
prerequisite for drawing in funds from the outside. Although individual corporations
were able to save, corporations as a whole had no savings in the entire period from 1929 to
1939. And between 1935 and 1938, dividend disbursements exceeded earnings by a billion a
year.
Corporations failed to save in the main because during the twenties they had
established high dividend rates which they were attempting to restore. The disbursements
of dividends were encouraged in 1936 and 1937 by the undistributed profits tax.
Of course, enterprises had depreciation allowances, but there were severe demands upon
these because of the postponed maintenance from the worst years of the depression.
Even when allowance is made for funds from depreciation allowances, the amounts
available for reinvestment by corporations in 1935 and 1936 were far smaller than in
1923, when the national income was comparable in amount. In 1923, undistributed
profits and depreciation of non-financial corporations were 5.3 billion dollars. In 1935
and 1936, undistributed profits, depreciation, and depletion were $2.0 billions and
$2.7 billions respectively. (T.N.E.C., Hearings, Part 9, "Savings and Investment,‚Äù p.
4039, Exhibit 582.)
An important aspect of plowed-back earnings is that they are venture capital. They
increase the equity of the business owners. Plowed-back earnings must be regarded as an
even more important dynamic influence than the investments of the well-to-do. In the five
years, 1922 to 1927, for example, business savings were 13.4 billion dollars. (S. Kuznets,
National Income and Capital Formation, 1919-1935, p. 24.) Income of persons receiving
more than $25,000 a year (after the payment of federal income taxes) in the same
period was 21.9 billion dollars. (Imre de Vegh, loc. cit.) If we assume that half of the
incomes above $25,000 were saved, the investment-seeking funds from this source in
the period 1922 to 1927, were not quite 11 billion dollars.
Many economists have regarded business savings as a deflationary influence. In
periods of contraction they probably are. The view that they are always a deflationary
influence overlooks the fact that expansion begins with the plowing back of earnings.
This is a preliminary step to getting outside capital. This is why business savings constitute
the spearhead of expansion. In order to judge the full effect of plowing back of
earnings, one must allow for its contagious effect. An expansion or improvement by one
competitor compels rivals to make investment in an attempt to hold their position. This
involves a "multiplier" which is different from the consumption multiplier used by
Keynes. The Keynesian multiplier is based upon the amount of additional consumption
which will be induced by a given expansion of investment. The investment multiplier indicates
the additional investment that will be directly induced by a given expansion of
investment.

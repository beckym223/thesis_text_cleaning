We live in the age of integration. Every conceivable-or inconceivable
combination of countries has been proposed, more or less
seriously, as a candidate for integration-other planets and outer
space being almost the only areas that do not yet figure in any of the
many plans and proposals. With the formation of the European Economic
Community, the European Common Market as a going concern,
integration has passed from the talking stage, where it had remained
for many years, into the stage of concrete realization. The example
of the Common Market, beside spawning a rival European combination
(EFTA), has induced the creation of similar schemes in other
parts of the world-in South and Central America-and still others
are on the drawing board. I do not intend to offer yet another comparative
analysis of any of those schemes. What I should like to do
is to put the modern integration movement into broader historical
perspective of the growing world economy.
Without wishing to engage in a lengthy discussion of the proper
or useful definition of terms, I think I should first indicate very briefly
what we mean by integration-I say "we" and not "I," because I hope
for fairly general agreement. We mean by integration closer economic
relations between the areas concerned. This is clearly a concept capable
of continuous gradation. One first stage is characterized by free
commodity trade, greater division of labor, tending toward equalization
of commodity prices. We have a higher stage of integration when
factors of production can move freely with a consequent tendency for
factor price equalization. (Allow me to skip the famous controversy
whether complete factor price equalization would result from free
commodity trade alone, with the remark that such equalization could
indeed result, but only under such unrealistic assumptions that for
practical purposes we can say that it would not. I hope that speaking

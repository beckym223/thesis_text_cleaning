THE ECONOMIST AND THE STATEÂ¹
By E. A. GOLDENWEISER
NUMBER ONE
According to Victorian reckoning, this is the Diamond Jubilee of the
American Economic Association. In the charter of incorporation of this
Association its purposes are stated as follows: "(1) The encouragement
of economic research . . . (2) The issue of publications on economic sub-
jects, and (3) The encouragement of perfect freedom of economic discus-

economic questions."
Admirable purposes and principles. In pursuing them the Association,
over the sixty years of its life, has rendered invaluable service to the
profession. It has offered an opportunity for economists to present their
ideas to colleagues and to have these ideas discussed at the meetings.

among economists.
But it has remained aloof from practical affairs. It has been academic,
though in the fine, not the derogatory, sense of the word. In the mean-
time profound changes have occurred in the life of the country. Not only

wide, nay, a world-wide significance. The United States can no longer
remain complacently aloof behind the oceans, nor the economist behind
the book stacks. An economist's study can no longer be his world; the
entire world must be his study.
To an ever-growing extent public authorities and national and inter-
national business enterprises turn to economists for advice and guid-

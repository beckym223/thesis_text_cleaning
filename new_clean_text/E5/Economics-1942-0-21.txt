no one can doubt that we are on the threshold of gaining a far better
standard of living than man has ever known. Nothing can prevent us
from realizing the possibilities of modern technology except unwilling-

larly our interests in enterprise, experimentation, innovation. Never

greater. The economic future of our country and of the world depends
upon the clarity with which this is seen.

Three years ago, Professor Viner addressed this association on "The
Short View and the Long in Economic Policy." With a levity quite
shocking in a presidential address, he epitomized his own message in
the aphorism, "There's life in the old dogmas yet." The following
year Professor Mills, speaking under the title "Economics in a Time
of Change," toyed with the idea that we might teach the old dogmas
some new tricks.

The canine pun which Professor Viner perpetrated and I have
extended turns my mind back to a story about a dog that appeared
among the last of Mark Twain's writings. It began: "My mother was
a Collie, my father was a St. Bernard, but I am a Presbyterian."
Observation leads me to conclude that economists by and large, in
spite of our mixed ancestry, are Presbyterians at heart. For the
Presbyterians lean toward traditional forms, ritualistic services, rigid
creeds, and doctrines of predestination and determinism.
The ancient dogmas for which Professor Viner made a plea are
essentially the benchmarks or the boundary posts of the economics of
the free market. And it was from "the free market as the battle-ground
of competitive forces" that Professor Mills began his inquiry as to
the course of economics in a time of change. The change which he
envisaged was largely in the nature of newer and, he hoped, more
adequate definitions of values in some fundamental and objective
sense which might guide the determination of pecuniary values in the
commercial market. Many among the ranks of both economists and
laymen have given up hope of attaining such a scheme of values
through the institutions of private business. Fascist and other totalitarian
regimes in various countries abroad propose to end the struggle

studies and in five of the six cross-section studies, the sum of k and j
is slightly less than unity. While this by no means establishes the
reality of true diminishing returns, since the differences between k+j
and unity are well within the range of the standard errors, there is at
least a faint suggestion to that effect. It is possible that American
manufacturing industry during this period may have exceeded the
optimum size and that the desire for the power and prestige which is
attached to bigness may have caused firms to be conducted on a larger
scale than that which was justified by the most efficient combination
of the factors of production.
While all due caution in drawing conclusions should be observed, it
would seem that the most likely long-run norm for k during the period
covered was between .63 and .64; and for j was approximately .34.
This would mean that a change of one per cent in the quantity of labor
(unaccompanied by any change in the quantity of capital) would
normally result during this period in a change in the same direction of
about sixty-three or sixty-four hundredths of one per cent in the
quantity of product, and that similarly a change of one per cent in
quantity of capital (unaccompanied by any change in the quantity of
labor) would normally result, during this period, in a change in the
same direction of about thirty-four hundredths of one per cent. If both
factors of production were increased by one per cent, then the total
product would normally increase during this period by from ninetyseven
to ninety-eight hundredths of one per cent.
If we disregard the slight suggestion of decreasing returns and treat
the most probable sum of the exponents as equal to unity, then an increase
of one per cent in the quantities of both labor and capital would
normally result in a corresponding increase of one per cent in product.
A one per cent increase in the quantity of labor alone would normally
be accompanied, during this period, by an increase of approximately
two-thirds of one per cent in product and an increase of one per cent
in the quantity of capital alone would normally be accompanied by
an approximate increase of one-third of one per cent in the product.
Perhaps this is as close a tentative conclusion as we should draw for
this period although further studies may lead to some revision of these
results.
Since under these conditions (i.e., k + j = 1.0) the clasticity of the
marginal productivity curves for a given factor is equal to the reciprocal
of the exponent for the other factors, that is eL

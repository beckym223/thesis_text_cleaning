No one aspect of the agricultural problem has received so much
emphasis in the recent past as the allegedly great disadvantage which
agriculture suffers because, due to the general inelasticity of the demand
for farm products, prices of farm products fall so sharply when
either supply increases or demand falls off. Particular importance is
assigned to these effects as they develop at the onset of business and
postwar recessions. It is time that one really take an all-square look at
these relationships in the large, as in Chart IV. This chart, with a base
period 1910-14 as 100, shows the changes in the total income to Labor,
Capital, and Agriculture since then. The Capital in this trichotomy
includes returns to nonfarm enterprise as well as interest, dividends
and rents. It is therefore closely identical with what is loosely referred
to as "Business." Returns to agriculture reached the lowest level in
the 1930's relative to the base, but returns to Capital broke the
sharpest and fell the most. Most business firms were in the red in
these years and business failures mounted to 30,000 a year in 1931 and
1932. Returns to labor fell the least and recovered the most by the onset
of the second world war. Wages were, of course, very low back in the
base years 1910-14 and had doubled coming out of the first world war,
and kept on advancing with rapid increase in output per worker in
the 1920's. There was vast unemployment, particularly in 1932, 1933,
and 1934, but even having one-fourth of the nonfarm working force
idle, so long as the wages of those employed hold up pretty well, does
not lower the total earnings of labor anywhere near the extent they
would be lowered by a break of a half or more in returns to agriculture
and business.
Over the whole period since 1910, only in the 1930's have returns to
business been set back for more than one or two years, and not very
much then. Returns to labor have followed in close parallel with returns
to business except that they have gained the most since 1929.
The magnitude of agriculture's recent setback should not be measured
from the exceptional years 1948 and 1951, but rather as down from
an index of around 325-330, which still means fully one-fifth in magnitude
by 1955. Taking the whole period since 1920, farm products have
been in surplus except in the second world war years and following to
1948, and the Korean War years 1951-52, as a consequence of which
farm incomes have only a little more than doubled in current dollars
since 1929 while returns to labor have multiplied nearly four times
and to business nearly three times.
It is interesting to observe the effects of the foregoing on the sharing
of the national income in prosperity and depression. The percentages

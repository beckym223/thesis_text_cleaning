THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
[MARCH
there has long been resort to governmental authority, in one sphere or
another, to protect particular interests or advance general well-being.
It is the complex of legal powers being exercised or sought which
brings to issue the outstanding controversies of the day in the field of
public policy. It is our prevailing system of law, the aggregate of gov-
ernmental prohibitions and requirements imposing restrictions upon
private enterprise and fashioning its character and direction, which
raises such fundamental questions as the appropriate scope of the
obligations of government to further economic welfare, the relation
between freedom and authority in the achievement of fruitful economic
results, the outlook for the preservation of democratic institutions in
the milieu of extensive public control of economic activity.
This legal system not only embraces the large accumulation of juridi-
cal principles and practices sanctioned or evolved at common law in the
piecemeal adjudication of disputes concerning the rights and duties of
private litigants, but includes also, more significantly for our present
purposes, the enormous mass of legislative enactments and adminis-
trative determinations-federal, state, and local-which, upon surviv-
ing the possibility of judicial censorship on constitutional grounds,
play an important r√¥le in the governance of economic behavior. While
this body of enactments and determinations, as interpreted by the
courts, has modified common-law doctrines in numerous ways, its most
far-reaching contribution lies in positive supplementation of the com-
mon law, through the establishment of standards and the enforcement
of policies designed to safeguard and promote the common good.
However adverse a reaction may be justified to the wisdom or propriety
of particular measures, the basic objectives of the legal system as thus
developed reflect a popular determination to improve economic con-
ditions, within the general framework of private enterprise, and a faith
in the efficacy of collective control.
Law as such evokes no opposition whatever in our midst, even from
those who are most firmly convinced that the contemporary expansion
of the legal system is calculated to destroy or subvert our economic
and political institutions. Indeed, insistence upon the supremacy of
law is voiced most uniformly and most vigorously by those who are
generally inhospitable to restrictive change effected through collective
action. But the law thus approved is primarily that which strengthens
the very industrial setup which is in course of modification-the legal
rules and practices designed to protect property rights, enforce contract
obligations, provide monetary mechanisms, sustain corporate activity,
define bankruptcy procedures, reward creative accomplishment, per-
petuate special privileges. Even in these spheres, however, which have
constituted the traditional legal foundations of economic conduct, a

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
Thus a large part of the retreat out of agriculture since 1940 has meant
actual physical migration only to the extent of traveling to work and
back each day.
Tangible Productive Assets
A full measure of agriculture's magnitude, however, requires in-
cluding its land and capital goods as well as its labor force, the capital
goods being largely stored-up labor used in further production in the
form of land improvements, seedings, orchards, growing timber, farm
buildings, farm equipment, productive livestock and workstock, etc.,
and comparing this with a parallel summation for nonfarm assets used
in production. This can be done with only rough approximation, as in
Table II. The most serious difficulty arises from the changes in the
price level, particularly as it affects different types of assets. It is for
this reason that the three price index series are included in Table II.
These in general have their high and low points at about the same
time, but the farm-product prices move over the widest range and the

of the U.S., Table 359. Included in neither farm nor nonfarm are values of dwellings and con-
sumer durables (including the consumption share of automobiles), public and institutional
property, monetary gold and silver, and foreign assets. Producer durables are divided between
farm and nonfarm.
b Per worker mainly employed in agriculture, in Table I.
*Not fully comparable with later years. Does not include demand deposits, included in
part in the series from 1940 forward.

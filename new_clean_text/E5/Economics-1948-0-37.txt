would expect the number of industries where the actual product fell
below the theoretical to exceed in number those where it was greater.
This was exactly what happened from 1904 to 1919. Why the opposite
result should have occurred in 1889 and to a much lesser degree in
1899, however, merits further study.

Even more important, however, is an analysis of each of the 87
American cases where the deviations were more than two standard
errors of estimate from the theoretical values and I only regret that
lack of time prevents a full analysis of these instances. Let us first
consider the forty in which the deviations were of a minus nature. In no
less than ten cases, these were in the flax, hemp, linen, jute and oakum
family of industries, which has always been one of the most "sweated"
groups in all industrial countries. Two were in allied "sweated‚Äù industries,
namely nets and seines (1904) and hammocks (1889), while
three more were connected with cotton which has generally been a
sub-standard industry. Three more, charcoal, waste, and canning
oysters, have been distinctly disagreeable and badly "sweated" industries,
while several others, such as grindstones, millstones, hooks and
eyes, etc., were instances of contracting demand.

On the other hand, the vast majority of the plus deviations which
amounted to more than two standard errors of estimate can be explained
as caused by (1) some form of quasi-monopoly or imperfect
competition, or (2) by expanding demand, or (3) by both factors.
Examples of the first are wood engraving, gold and silver reducing,
lapidary work, music publishing, glucose, starch, linseed oil, patent
medicines, tin plate, brass, and lead. These in themselves accounted
for nineteen of the markedly plus deviations.

Illustrations of the second group, namely those caused by an expanding
demand, were cordials and flavoring syrups (1909, 1914,
1919), oleomargarine (1914), perfumery (1919), and washing machines
(1919).

There is also a third class of plus deviations which was probably
affected both by imperfect competition and by expanding demand. Illustrations
of this group are airplanes (1914), chewing gum (1919),
cigars and cigarettes (1919), fountain pens (1914), photographic supplies
and equipment (1904, 1909, 1914), cash registers (1889), smelting
and refining copper (1899, 1904), typewriters and supplies (1889).
A very large majority of the major deviations so far as the United
States is concerned, were, therefore, precisely what we would expect
on a priori grounds. Belief in the function as a description of "normal"
relationships is, therefore, still further strengthened.

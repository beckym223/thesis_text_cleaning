In 1940, output per man-hour in American nonagricultural industries
was roughly double that of 1920. In few periods of history has capacity
to produce goods grown more rapidly than in the last twenty years. The
industrial research staffs of American business in 1940 were nine times
as large as in 1920, and so also were expenditures on research. At no
time in the country's history had its capacity to increase production
been so great. And yet the community which possessed this unparalleled
productive capacity to improve methods and products did not glory in
its strength. It was perplexed and baffled. Instead of looking forward
confidently to achieving ever rising standards of living, it dreaded the
future. It asked whether investment opportunities were becoming per-
manently insufficient, whether the rules for achieving prosperity were
undergoing fundamental changes, whether new conditions were making
its economic institutions no longer workable.
This sense of doubt and inadequacy did not exist, in the United States
at least, before 1929. It was created by the depression and by the dis-
appointing recovery. The great national effort required by the war may
prove to be precisely what is needed to restore the country's faith in its
capacity to master great problems. Nevertheless, the task of winning
the peace requires that we face frankly the questions raised by the de-
pression and the disappointing recovery. Is it true that new conditions—
the decline in geographical expansion, the drop in population growth,
shifts in economic and political power, and changes in public policy—
are radically altering the problem of maintaining employment, so that
plans for the post-war world must envisage important changes in policies
and institutions? The thesis of these remarks is that the answer to this
question is a qualified Yes.

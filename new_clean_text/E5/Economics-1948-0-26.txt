Wickens, "The Commonwealth Statistical Allocation of Factory Output," Econ. Record
(1929), pp. 226-33. The values of k and j for the industry aggregates were .56 and .42, re-
spectively. The results of the plant averages for the Commonwealth for the years 1912, 1922-
23, 1926-27, 1936-37 were previously published. It was found that the values of k and j
did not change greatly. Only one value of k, that for 1922-23, differed from the aggregate
k, by an amount greater than σk. For further discussion, see Gunn and Douglas, "The Pro-
duction Function for Australian Manufacturing," Quart. Jour. Econ., Vol. ĹVI (Nov.,
1941), pp. 108-29.
plants is concerned. While much more study is needed to develop and
to clarify this point, it is suggested that quite possibly American plants
during this period were in practice developed beyond the point of
maximum efficiency. Whether or not the differences between the re-
spective kj's can be taken as a coefficient of managerial megalo-
mania, I shall have to leave to the psychiatrists.24
* If this is a psychiatric problem, we can take consolation in the fact that the disease
was apparently less acute in 1919 than in 1889.

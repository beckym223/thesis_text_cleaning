THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
It is submitted that the results are, on the whole, corroborative. If
they were purely accidental, as some have charged, they would show
widely varying results. The fact that on the basis of fairly wide studies
there is an appreciable degree of uniformity, and that the sum of the
For Victoria, the value of b was .97 and for New South Wales, 1.02. In all these cases, b
represents the value of the intercept with the functional plane of theoretical product merely
moved up or down by the small difference between the values of b and unity. In the time
series, of course, we are dealing with index numbers which show relative changes, not
absolute values.
B. Under formula (2) (i.e., P= bL*CÂ³) b deviates in a greater degree from unity because
of the greater degree of freedom given to the exponent for capital. Here the values for

For Victoria b is .71 and for New South Wales, .97.

C. In the cross-section or inter-industry studies, b still represents the intercept but it is
also a conversion factor which translates the number of employees and dollars of invested
capital into dollars of net value product. As in the case of the time series based on index
numbers, b is generally higher under formula (2) when the values of j are independently
determined than under formula (1). It also tends to move in some direct ratio with changes
in the general price level, being generally higher in those years when the price level is
higher and vice versa. There are, however, occasional exceptions to this rule. These tendencies
are shown in the following tables for the United States:

equations in a book on The Theory of Production which I hope shortly to publish with
Miss Grace Gunn.

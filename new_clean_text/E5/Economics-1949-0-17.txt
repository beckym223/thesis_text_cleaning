and it is in fact easy to see that certain social groups are further
removed than are others from those ranges of social life in which
ideologies acquire additional vigor in economic or political conflict. But
though they may be relatively free from the ideologies of the practitioners,
they develop not less distorting ideologies of their own. There
is more comfort in the observation that no economic ideology lasts
forever and that, with a likelihood that approximates certainty, we
eventually grow out of each. This follows not only from the fact that
social patterns change and that hence every economic ideology is bound
to wither but also from the relation that ideology bears to that prescientific
cognitive act which we have called vision. Since this act
induces fact finding and analysis and since these tend to destroy whatever
will not stand their tests, no economic ideology could survive
indefinitely even in a stationary social world. As time wears on and
these tests are being perfected, they do their work more quickly and
more effectively. But this still leaves us with the result that some
ideology will always be with us and so, I feel convinced, it will.
But this is no misfortune. It is pertinent to remember another aspect
of the relation between ideology and vision. That prescientific cognitive
act which is the source of our ideologies is also the prerequisite of our
scientific work. No new departure in any science is possible without
it. Through it we acquire new material for our scientific endeavors
and something to formulate, to defend, to attack. Our stock of facts and
tools grows and rejuvenates itself in the process. And soâ€”though we
proceed slowly because of our ideologies, we might not proceed at all
without them.

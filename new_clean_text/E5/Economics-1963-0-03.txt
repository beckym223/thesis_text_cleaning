The question I propose to consider is whether or to what extent the
current relations between government and various interest groups in
the United States prevent, or at least handicap, the attainment of stability
and growth. That this question is both serious and difficult requires
no argument. It is now six years since we have experienced a
level of unemployment as low as 4 per cent of the labor force. During
this period the growth of national income has been substantially below.
the long-term trend. During this same period nearly all of the advanced
countries of Western Europe have established an employment
record much better than ours and most of them have attained a growth
rate which, though it may not persist, is currently at least double the
U.S. rate. Are the relations between government, business, and labor
in these countries more conducive to stability and growth and, if so, is
there something we could learn from them?
Stabilization, of course, must be interpreted within the context of a
continuous increase in the labor force and the employment of capital.
It is a necessary but not sufficient condition to the attainment of whatever
is considered to be a feasible and adequate growth rate. The
movement from a relatively high to a relatively satisfactory level of
unemployment is not a once-and-for-all step towards higher national
income but a preliminary condition to a growth rate that is probably
somewhat higher than is possible with substantial slack in the economy.
Obviously stabilization policy does not encompass the whole of
the growth problem. Denison has made us familiar with some of the
steps that would need to be taken if we seek to raise the full employment
growth rate [2]. The prospects for growth can also be affected
by the choice of routes toward full employment. I am not, however,

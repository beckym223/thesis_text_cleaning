I
What I am going to say might have most appropriately been given as
an introduction to the program of which we are now in the midst. On
the other hand, for reasons which will appear, I wish I could have
waited until I could have heard all the papers and their discussion. The
program grew out of my feeling that we needed very badly to have a
cooperative look at the nature of our economic system as it exists now
just past the midcentury. This feeling has been growing now for the
thirty years during which I have wrestled as an academic with the complexities
of economic theory in lecture and in seminar.
This feeling has been accentuated, not only as I have had the opportunity
to observe the operation of economic systems fundamentally
different from our own, such as the Soviet and the Nazi economic systems,
but as I have observed, somewhat less intimately, economic
systems which represented lesser divergencies from our own, such as
that of the United Kingdom under the Labour government and those
of the Scandinavian countries.
When I went to Russia immediately before the onset of the great depression,
our own economy was still generally considered the epitome of
capitalism. Soviet Russia, by contrast, was the only country with any
significant degree of industrialization which no longer adhered to the
capitalistic system. What are we to say of the situation today? Is
capitalism stronger in the world now than then, or weaker? Have the national
economies of the world become more highly â€œstatized" or is there
a recrudescence both of competition and of laissez faire in the world?

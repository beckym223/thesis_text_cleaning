It is not only power and machinery that is being substituted for man
labor; fertilizers and lime, pesticides, improved seed, and better feeding
practices and the like commonly increase yields well out of proportion
to the increase of labor entailed, and thus in effect substitute capital
for labor. In 1950, the cash outlays for feed, seeds, fertilizer, lime,
sprays, feeder cattle and hogs, hatching eggs and chicks, fuel oil, irrigation
water, and other purchased items were nearly 40 per cent of the
value of the farm output; in 1920 they were only a little over 20 per
cent of it. On a large truck farm in the East, the outlays on "chemicals"
(fertilizers, sprays, etc.) are larger than those for labor.
Involved in the distribution of the labor force between farm and nonfarm
sectors is not only the obvious basic factor that food is making
up a smaller and smaller part of human consumption, but that more
of what is spent for food is not spent for the food itself, but for the
processing and the marketing that go with it and for meals eaten outside
the home. The consumers of this country have been spending
slightly more than 25 per cent of their disposable income for food since
the second world war. If their disposable income increases 54 per cent
per capita by 1975, and they consume only 11 per cent more food per
capita, as the P.M.P.C. report projects, they would be spending only
18 per cent of their disposable income for food. But this would be
a phenomenon the like of which has seldom been witnessed in modern
times. What we can expect instead is that a good part of the difference
between the 18 and the 25 per cent will be spent in buying more of
what goes with the food and this will add further to the nonfarm labor
force.

Projection to 1975

The projections to 1975 in Chart I are based upon the following
further analysis. First, a farm labor force of 5 millions is definitely accepted
as most reasonable to expect, with the number of farms between
3.8 and 4.0 millions and between 1.25 and 1.30 workers per
farm. Next, the percentage of the farm population that works on farms
is reduced from 26.5 in 1950 to 25.0 on the expectation that still more
members of farm families will work at nonfarm jobs. This will mean a
farm population of 20 millions, or 9.5 per cent of the total population,
matched against 13.5 per cent in 1950. If 40 per cent of the 189.5 nonfarm
population are on the nonfarm labor force, the same as in 1950,
this will make a nonfarm labor force of 76 millions compared with 59
millions in 1955. Of the total labor force of 81 millions, around 6 percent
will be employed on farms compared with 10 per cent in 1955.
The value of the farm land and buildings, equipment, livestock and
other productive assets per farm worker will not continue to increase

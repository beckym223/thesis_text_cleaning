distribution of cases with the only departures of the actual from
theoretical values being those caused by random errors of measure-
ment and of sampling, we would expect that in 68.3 per cent of the cases

the actual values would deviate from the theoretical values by less
than one standard error of estimate, and that in 95 per cent of the
cases the actual values would deviate from the theoretical values by
less than two such standard errors. In only one per cent of the cases
would the actual values deviate by more than three standard errors of
estimate. Then in our charts of the cross-section or inter-industry

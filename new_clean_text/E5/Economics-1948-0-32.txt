errors of estimate. The distribution of the observations in this
sample is, therefore, somewhat better than that which we would expect

The fact that we have, therefore, in practice, a somewhat closer
distribution of the actual values about the line of the theoretical values
25a While charts showing the distribution of the individual products about the line of
theoretical relationship have been prepared for the British Dominion, these are not published
in this article because of considerations of space and expense. They were, however,
shown in connection with the address.

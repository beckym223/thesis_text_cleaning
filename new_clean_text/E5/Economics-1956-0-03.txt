The nation whose agriculture will be analyzed in this address is
almost solely that of the United States of America. Other nations will
be brought into it only where international trade and other relations
are involved. This does not mean that significant parallels and con-
trasts with other nations cannot be made, but there will be no time and
space for them tonight.
The analysis will begin with a statement of the relative magnitude
and importance of agriculture in the nation's economy, and past trends
in the same, according to several measures. This will be followed by
projections of the changes in these magnitudes by 1975 and after, and
accompanying changes in land use. Then will come an analysis of the
welfare aspects of the subject, how agriculture is sharing in the na-
tional income and improvements in living, and the outlook for the
same. Deviations from trend in wars and postwars and in and out of
business recessions will receive attention in this section. The analysis
up to this point will then be brought to a head in a statement of the
meaning of the foregoing for agriculture and for the nation. This will
point up the economic problems facing American agriculture, which
will then be defined and briefly analyzed in terms of policy and pro-
gram. The final section of this address will consider briefly some of the
political aspects of the solution of these problems.
What I am saying next may seem to some entirely unnecessary, but
in fact it is not. It is that the analysis will be from the point of view
of the over-all economy, not that of within the agricultural part of it.
What is said on some points may therefore even come as a shock to
some who have been reared as agricultural economists within agri-
culture.
The point in time which will be taken as the present will be 1954 or

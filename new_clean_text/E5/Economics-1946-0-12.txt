THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
[MARCH
proposals are attacked as fundamentally subversive of our cherished
heritage the adoption of needed controls is sometimes retarded, and
what is even more important, the controls actually incorporated into
our legal system tend to be largely molded by their militant proponents,
whose advocacy is often equally extreme in the sweeping constructive
expectations which it holds forth. Since the precise character of controls
and the procedural safeguards surrounding them are not infrequently
more important than the mere fact of their establishment, this approach
comes to be a self-defeating one on the part of the regulated interests,
and the community at large tends to be deprived of the balancing
influence of those most immediately concerned and most intimately
acquainted with the complexities involved. It is one of the striking facts
of our economic history that, except in grave emergencies, commercial
and industrial interests have stubbornly opposed practically all restric-
tive or positive control measures of importance, usually on what they
professed to be fundamental legal and economic grounds, however
readily they may subsequently have adjusted themselves to the new
environment created by these measures. Among the more comprehensive
considerations that have thus been invoked in obstructing and impair-
ing the development of economic policy are those reflected in relatively
unrelieved stress upon the maintenance of individual freedom, in
condemnation of government as a virtually unmixed evil, in repudiation
of politics as a necessarily maleficent activity.
There is a substantial parallelism between undue emphasis upon
national sovereignty in international relations and a similar over-
emphasis of individual freedom in domestic relations. Both are
expressions of a basic isolationism in face of closely knit and
interdependent conditions of social living. There can be no question
that freedom from restraint, whether it be the external restraint of alien
states or the internal restraint of domestic governmental authority, is
among the most fundamental of our values and is largely responsible
for our fruitful accomplishments. But untrammeled freedom of action
has never prevailed in either sphere. It has always been recognized
that both national and individual liberty, if allowed uninhibited sway,
are themselves likely to generate serious restraints, and that deliberate
restrictions may be necessary to achieve the largest measure of attain-
able freedom. National sovereignty has not precluded ready acceptance
of the numerous self-imposed limitations contained in compacts or
treaties negotiated between states, nor has the individualism of our
system of private enterprise precluded the collective establishment of
numerous controls. When achieved through democratic processes, in
response to demonstrated general need, these measures of economic
control tend to implement and enrich individual freedom, just as

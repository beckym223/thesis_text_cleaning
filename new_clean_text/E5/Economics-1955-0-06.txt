data, and so on through a long list. Consequently, the trends in the
income structure can be discerned but dimly, and the results considered
as preliminary informed guesses.
The data are for the United States, England, and Germany-a scant
sample, but at least a starting point for some inferences concerning
long-term changes in the presently developed countries. The general
conclusion suggested is that the relative distribution of income, as
measured by annual income incidence in rather broad classes, has been
moving toward equality-with these trends particularly noticeable
since the 1920's but beginning perhaps in the period before the first
world war.
Let me cite some figures, all for income before direct taxes, in support
of this impression. In the United States, in the distribution of income
among families (excluding single individuals), the shares of the
two lowest quintiles rise from 13 per cent in 1929 to 18 per cent in the
years after the second world war (average of 1944, 1946, 1947, and
1950); whereas the share of the top quintile declines from 55 to 44 per
cent, and that of the top 5 per cent from 31 to 20 per cent. In the
United Kingdom, the share of the top 5 per cent of units declines from
46 per cent in 1880 to 43 per cent in 1910 or 1913, to 33 per cent in
1929, to 31 per cent in 1938, and to 24 per cent in 1947; the share of
the lower 85 per cent remains fairly constant between 1880 and 1913,
between 41 and 43 per cent, but then rises to 46 per cent in 1929 and
55 per cent in 1947. In Prussia income inequality increases slightly
between 1875 and 1913-the shares of the top quintile rising from 48
to 50 per cent, of the top 5 per cent from 26 to 30 per cent; the share
of the lower 60 per cent, however, remains about the same. In Saxony,
the change between 1880 and 1913 is minor: the share of the two
lowest quintiles declines from 15 to 14% per cent; that of the third
quintile rises from 12 to 13 per cent, of the fourth quintile from 16½
to about 18 per cent; that of the top quintile declines from 56½ to
54½ per cent, and of the top 5 per cent from 34 to 33 per cent. In
Germany as a whole, relative income inequality drops fairly sharply
from 1913 to the 1920's, apparently due to decimation of large fortunes
and property incomes during the war and inflation; but then
begins to return to prewar levels during the depression of the 1930's.¹

under the formula than we would normally expect, is all the more
striking in view of the fact that the values of the production function
need not be the same within all industries or allied groups of industries.

As I have constantly pointed out during the last twenty years, there
is no reason why the exponents of capital and labor should be constant
for all periods and economies. As a matter of fact, we have already
seen that they are not and that there is some variation between coun-
tries and years in the values of k and j. We would similarly expect
some variation to exist as between groups of industries within a country
at any given time. Thus the values of the production function for the

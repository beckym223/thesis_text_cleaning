economically, it has devoted a smaller share of its productive effort and
resources to producing agricultural products, as indicated by the series
for share of the GNP. Consequently, although agriculture has grown
with the nation, it has grown more slowly. The comparison in con-
stant dollars is, for the over-all economy, an increase of 3.6 times from
1910 to 1953, and for agriculture, an increase of 2.7 times. For the
period 1929 to 1953, the comparison is 2.1 times for the over-all econ-
omy, and 1.4 for agriculture. There is nothing abnormal about this
divergence. But the extent of such divergence is likely to vary much
among nations depending upon their resources, rate of growth and
earnings level, and foreign trade.
The other outstanding feature in the picture of change here pre-
sented is the rapid substitution of capital goods for labor in the agri-
cultural input mix since 1940-labor down from 17.1 to 10.0 per cent
of the national labor force, and the share of productive assets used in
agriculture up fully as much. The share of the gross national product
actually increased from 1940 to 1951 along with this substitution, but
with a booming business economy since and declining prices for farm
products, the 7.5 of 1951 has shrivelled to 6.0 or below. The develop-

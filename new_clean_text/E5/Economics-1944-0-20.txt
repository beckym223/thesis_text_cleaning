us in her magnificent address to the Congress last year, we should not
be visionary, but we should have vision. Without vision the people
perish. Vision means imagination, ideals, and values. The true states-
man has vision. If, in the past decade, we have had some adroit and
successful politics, we have also had magnificent and far-sighted states-
manship. And now? Now, and in the post-war years, there is as great
need as we have ever had for statesmanship broad in perspective, deep
in insight, forward-looking not only to tomorrow but to future genera-
tions, and with the ability, not only to make the pragmatic compro-
mises necessary in the exigencies and conflicts of the moment, but to
hold a steady and undaunted course toward the fuller and fairer realiza-
tion of the values that civilized men and women live by.
The country, the world, needs men-informed men and women--
who, with their feet on the hard ground of facts, give thought to basic,
permanent values, and to the broad and long-run policies required for
their realization. The call is not to men and women of superficial insight
or narrow sympathies. It is a clarion call to young economists and
political scientists-young in spirit if not in years-to hear and to heed,
each according to his faith in his own developed capacities. So I say to
them, as I say to the business men: Lift up your sights; extend your
range.

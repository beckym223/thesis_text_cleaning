concerning the fruitfulness of freedom of international trade and
investment have come to be conditioned, in light of the disruptive and
depressing effects of recent trends to economic autarchy, by the
efficacy of institutional arrangements for international economic
coöperation. Not only must consideration be given to the purposes and
probable results of such emerging world agencies as those for monetary
stabilization and economic reconstruction and development, but the
solution of numerous related problems is likewise dependent in large
measure upon concert of action. Problems of commercial policy, capital
movements, cartel arrangements, commodity agreements, technological
restrictions, shipping adjustments, agricultural relationships-whether
ostensibly attacked as matters primarily of national concern or frankly
viewed in their international implications as well as in their domestic
aspects must necessarily be recognized as intricate problems of public
policy. They embrace the distinctive economic circumstances of foreign
areas as well as our own needs and aspirations; they are complicated
by a diversity of national and international goals; they involve much
more than the mere analysis of economic factors in terms of established
economic principles.

And our concern with matters of policy is equally clear in most of
the remaining subjects of discussion. The reëxamination of the outlook
for effective competition, after more than a half-century of checkered
governmental effort to this end, not only necessitates a consideration
of the vitality of contemporary competitive rivalry and the feasibility,
under prevailing circumstances of ownership and control, of relying
predominantly upon the free operation of economic forces, but raises
also crucial questions of principle and practice bearing upon the definition
and maintenance of competitive conditions, and brings to issue the
rather perplexing relationship between competitive policy and positive
measures of collective enterprise and public control. These affirmative
policies, furthermore, even when confined to such so-called naturally
monopolistic industries as railroads and public utilities, require constant
and informed appraisal, in the interest of evolving regulatory standards
and expedients which in terms of actual performance are effectively
adjusted to the changing circumstances and conditions of our economic
development. The prevailing status of labor relations has likewise been
molded in large measure by governmental activity. The strengthening
of labor's position, as a result of statutory and administrative implementation
of its right to collective bargaining through freely chosen
representatives, has aroused deep concern in many quarters over the
monopolistic potentialities of vast labor organizations; and the use of
immense economic power by these organizations, through resort to the
strike weapon as the culminating phase of abortive collective bargaining

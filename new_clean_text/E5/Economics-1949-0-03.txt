NUMBER TWO
I
A hundred years ago economists were much more pleased with
their performance than they are today. But I submit that, if complacency
can ever be justified, there is much more reason for being
complacent today than there was then or even a quarter of a century
ago. As regards command of facts, both statistical and historical, this
is so obviously true that I need not insist. And if it be true of our
command of facts, it must be true also for all the applied fields that
for their advance mainly depend upon fact finding. I must insist,
however, on the proposition that our powers of analysis have grown
in step with our stock of facts. A new organon of statistical methods
has emerged, to some extent by our own efforts, that is bound to mean
as much to us as it does to all the sciences, such as biology or experimental
psychology, the phenomena of which are given in terms of
frequency distributions. In response to this development and in alliance
with it, as well as independently, our own box of analytic tools
has been greatly enriched: economic theory, in the instrumental sense
of the term in which it means neither the teaching of ultimate ends
of policy nor explanatory hypotheses but simply the sum total of our
methods of handling facts-has grown quite as much as Marshall
and Pareto had foreseen that it would.
If this is not more generally recognized and if it is etiquette with
economists let alone the public-to pass derogatory judgment on
the state of our science, this is owing to a number of causes that,
though known all too well, should be repeated: a building plot on
which old structures are being torn down and new ones erected is
not an esthetic thing to behold; moreover, to a most discouraging extent
the new structures are being currently discredited by premature attempts
at utilitarian application; finally, the building area widens so

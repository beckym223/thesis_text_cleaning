a The Victorian index numbers for Labor, Capital, and Product from which the results were
computed, were constituted as follows: (1) Labor (L) = average number of persons employed
including wage earners, salaried employees, supervisory officials, and working employers;
(2) Capital (C) = fixed capital reduced to dollars of constant purchasing power but excluding
land values and working capital; (3) Product (P) =index of physical production using 1911
value weights. See Handsaker and Douglas, "The Theory of Marginal Productivity Tested by
Data for Manufacturing in Victoria," Quart. Jour. Econ., Vol. LII (Nov., 1937), pp. 1–36.
b The New South Wales study is based on series for Labor, Capital, and Product, which are
virtually identical in their definition with those of Victoria. The capital index differs from that
constructed earlier by Mr. Director in that it does not provide for the replacement at differing
price levels for the estimated depreciation on capital. For the Director study, see Douglas,
The Theory of Wages, pp. 167–172.
In the Commonwealth cross-section studies, the terms are defined as follows: (1) Labor
(L) = average number employed of wage earners and salaried employees but generally exclud-
ing working proprietors (except in 1934–35); (2) Capital (C) = value of plant and machinery,
buildings, and land, but excluding working capital. The exclusion of working capital is the
chief dissimilarity between this series and the definition of total capital used in the case of the
United States and Canadian cross-section studies. We will try to revise the Australian capital
figures to include working capital but this may be difficult. (3) Product (P) = value added by
manufacturing. For all the years except 1934-35, this was defined as gross sales value minus
(a) cost of materials used, (b) cost of fuel and light, and (c) cost of replacing tools and repairs
to plants. In the 1934-35 study estimated deductions were made for fire insurance and work-
men's compensation premiums, and also for estimated depreciation rates on the various types
of capital goods used based on the rates estimated in the Production Bulletin, No. 29, Com-
monwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. For a further discussion of these issues, see Gunn

the materialization of Sir William's forecast. J. S. Davis, having reviewed
its basis and nonmaterialization, declared in 1932 that "the
specter of coming dearth of food is a ghost that deserves to be laid"
[13].
The shift in the bias of the resource base from organic to inorganic
facilitated a higher rate of development and some economy in transport
already near the beginning of the nineteenth century, if not earlier.
It did not become pronounced until later in the century, however.
Thus, between 1880 and 1937, while world population was growing
about two-thirds and its industrial production was almost sextupling,
world metal and fuel production increased 606 and 652 per cent, respectively
[14] [31, pp. 248-50]. The shift, however, added to the
fear of classical diminishing returns, the additional fear of mineral depletion,
analogue of soil-fertility depletion. Already in 1865 W. S. Jevons
forecasted that rising costs of coal attendant upon the working
out of the superior seams would depress British industry and trade
[19]. A quarter-century later, there arose even in the United States
concern respecting both soil depletion and unduly rapid mineral exhaustion.
This concern contributed to the development of the conservation
movement later popularized by anti-Malthusian Theodore Roosevelt.

2. Malthus as well as subsequent writers drew attention to the externalities
associated with population growth, many of them adverse. A
clear-cut distinction was not initially made, however, between externalities
produced directly and externalities produced indirectly
through urban concentration. Malthus and his successors hoped to
control aggregate growth and thus minimize the impact of adverse externalities
through institutional and related controls of private origin,
that channeled costs and benefits to responsible and discretionary individuals
and households. He had little confidence in Leviathan. In fact
J. S. Mill was almost alone in believing that under communism-albeit
small-scale communism rather than present-day bureaucratic socialistic
or mixed-economy collectivisms-the feedback system generative of
population-control would be much more effective than it was under noncommunism
(Principles, II, i, 3) Concern regarding externalities associated
with urban growth became both more intense and more research-
oriented toward the close of the century. Even Marshall manifested
such concern [24].
3. In the wake of this growing awareness of externalities there developed
interest in improvement of the quality of populations. While
few economists had the faith of a Helvetius or a Bentham in the capacity
of education to eliminate inequality, not many attached to reproductive
selection the importance assigned it by F. Galton's followers

Economists are indebted to Thorstein Veblen for his emphasis on
the role that institutional factors play in economic thinking. To Veblen,
what economists believed and had to say about the operation of eco-
nomic forces in a price system was essentially a logical formulation
of the preconceptions and observations of those whose daily lives
were subjected to the impact of the system. As he expressed it, "The
higher theoretical knowledge, that body of tenets which rises to the
dignity of a philosophical or scientific system . . . is a complex of habits
of thought which reflect the habits of life embodied in the institutional
structure of society..." [31, p. 44]. More specifically, about classical
theory Veblen said: â€œIn the days of the early classical writers eco-
nomics had a vital interest for the layman of the time, because it for-
mulated the commonsense metaphysics of the time in its application
to a department of human life" [31, p. 69].
Wesley Clair Mitchell, close friend and admirer of Veblen, expressed
a similar thought throughout his brilliant lectures on types of economic
theory at Columbia University. Economic doctrines, he told his stu-
dents, represent intellectual responses to ever-changing economic prob-
lems. The problems economists think about and the way they think
about them are determined by the institutional matrix in which they
find themselves. Around this idea he built his course in the development
of economic thought from Adam Smith to John R. Commons.
As a background for a similar interpretation of current economic
thinking, I shall lean heavily upon what Mitchell had to say about what
Adam Smith taught and why he taught it.
Smith was primarily a political economist, not an economic logician.
It is true that he formulated principles governing the determination of

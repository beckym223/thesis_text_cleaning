compare the actual with the resulting theoretical products, we could
doubtless find the resulting deviations to be appreciably less than those
obtained when we treat all manufacturing as a whole. The fact that we do
get such a good fit when we treat all of the industries as homogeneous
is, therefore, all the more remarkable. It seems, further, to suggest that
to the degree that the values of k and j do differ between groups of

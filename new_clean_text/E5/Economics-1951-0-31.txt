as reached by print-if so disposed. But, though no prophet, I will
predict that no invention will ever enable one to listen or attend to
more than one other at a time, or to “send” and “receive” communications
at the same time.
To conclude: Time was, no doubt, when society needed to be
awakened to the possibility of remedying evils, and stirred to action,
mostly negative action, establishing freedom, but some positive action
too. Now, we have found not only that mere individual freedom is not
enough, but that its excess can have disastrous consequences. And a
reaction has set in, so that people have too much faith in positive
action, of the nature of passing laws and employing policemen, and the
opposite warning is needed. At least so I hold; perhaps it is a prejudice
-how can one tell?—I mistrust reformers. When a man or group asks
for power to do good, my impulse is to say, "Oh, yeah, who ever wanted
power for any other reason? and what have they done when they got
it?” So, I instinctively want to cancel the last three words, leaving
simply "I want power"; that is easy to believe. And, a further confession:
I am reluctant to believe in doing good with power anyhow.
With William James, I incline to the side of "the slow and silent
forces," slow as in all conscience they are-and though time is fleeting.
There is much more that should be said, but certainly not on this
occasion. When I started this I knew, from experience, that I'd never
finish it. Life seems to consist of "unfinished business." And, having
already imposed on you too long, without waiting for the peremptory
order that is given to naughty corporations, I simply cease and desist.

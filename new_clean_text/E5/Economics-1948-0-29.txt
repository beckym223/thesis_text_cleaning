studies, we have plotted the logs of the theoretical or expected products
on the vertical scale and of the actual products on the horizontal scale.
Since the values of scale are the same on both axes, the line BB' (with
a slope of unity) is the locus of all those points for which the theoretical

values of the product are identical with the actual values. In these
studies for a given year, it will be remembered that each industry
constitutes a separate observation.
The degree of departure of the actual from the theoretical values is,
therefore, shown by either the horizontal or the vertical distance of a
given point from the line BB'. We have, therefore, marked out on each

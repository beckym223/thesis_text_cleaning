THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
As to our profession, I have pointed to two desiderata: (1) that
economists acquire more proficiency in dealing with the problems of
how an economy functions when it is organized in large administrative
groups, and (2) that they be put in positions to deliver this technical
knowledge to the administrative officers of the respective groups who
are the responsible parties to the negotiation of economic relations and
the drafting and execution of business programs. Instead of being put
in a position of irresponsible power in a bureaucracy, it is much better
for the economist to be associated with one of the interest groups in
business as a consultative and experimental scientist, without any
authority to shape action or even any prerogative to formulate policy.
As a scientist all that is incumbent upon him to say is that if certain
actions are taken certain consequences may be expected to follow. It is
for the executives to act in the light of this professional counsel, subject
to review by the members of the underlying group organization.
Finally, in aligning myself with Professor Viner in support of the
view that "there's life yet in the old dogma of the free market," I do
not appear as apologist for a dogma-in-the-manger, asserting its own
logical perfection but neither rendering useful service to mankind nor
standing aside for the coming of more serviceable economic doctrines
and institutions. I appear as apostle for a dogma that perpetuates the
age-old wisdom of economic men learned at successive stages of busi-
ness development, a dogma old but ever renewed through its capacity
to give service, a dogma congenial to the minds of freedom-loving men
and ready to serve them again and yet more fully in the economic tasks
of our new day.

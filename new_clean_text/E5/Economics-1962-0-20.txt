we ought to be. Our map of the world differs from that of the layman.
Perhaps our map will never be a best seller. But a discipline like economics
has a logic and validity of its own. We believe in our map
because we cannot help doing so. In Frank Ramsey's beautiful quotation
from William Blake:
"Truth can never be told so as to be understood and not be believed."
Ours is an uncertain truth and economic scholars are humble about
its precision-but our humbleness is built out of knowledge, not out of
ignorance.
Not for us is the limelight and the applause. But that doesn't mean
the game is not worth the candle or that we do not in the end win
the game. In the long run, the economic scholar works for the only
coin worth having-our own applause.ยน

#### Split:
11 Lest I be misunderstood, I elaborate. This is not a plea for "Art for its own sake,"
"Logical elegance for the sake of elegance." It is not a plea for leaving the real-world
problems of political economy to noneconomists. It is not a plea for short-run popularity
with members of a narrow in-group. Rather it is a plea for calling shots as they really
appear to be (on reflection and after weighing all evidences), even when this means losing
popularity with the great audience of men and running against "the spirit of the times."

BLACK: AGRICULTURE IN THE NATION'S ECONOMY
Labor Force
15
We are now in a position to project the labor force, productive as-
sets, and gross national product of agriculture in 1975. With respect
to labor force, it is of interest that Colin Clark, in a review of the
P.M.P.C. report in the Review of Economics and Statistics in August
1954, predicted that by 1975 only 2 million workers will be left on
farms in the United States. He arrived at this forecast by projecting
forward geometrically the 13 per cent decline between 1950 and 1953.
To begin with, the available data indicate no decline in the farm labor
force in 1954 and 1955, so that the 13 per cent over five years is only
2.6 per cent a year instead of 4.7%; and to project forward in the same
chart the decline from 1940 to 1953 would give something like 3.5 mil-
lion in 1975. But we in this country all recognize that the movement
from the farms after 1940 was unduly large because it had been un-
duly small in the 1930's and because of the war. Projecting forward
on the basis of the decline in the two decades from 1930 to 1950 would
give a figure of around 5 millions, 1 per cent a year figured geometri-
cally. These 5 million workers could be employed on 4 million farms,
an average of 1.25 workers per farm.
Whatever rate of decline is projected forward, it will eventually reach
the zero line and we shall have no agriculture left, all of our land hav-
ing grown up to weeds, grass, brush and trees. Nothing more than an
arithmetical projection of the line of descent in Chart II from 1850 on
would bring it clear to zero by 1975. Of course this line will begin to
level off presently. But some have been saying this ever since 1900.
When will this leveling off begin? The projection labeled (a) in Chart
II indicates my conception of this, in contrast with Clark's labeled
(b). Projecting forward the 1850-to-1940 decrease, or that of 1930 to
1950, would give a zero point about the same as Clark's.
Any projection of the farm labor force must, of course, take into
account the rate of substitution of capital for labor in agriculture. Stud-
ies of the integration of the use of labor and machinery that Harvard
University has been promoting in recent years, aided by a grant from
the Ferguson Foundation, in five major type-of-farming regions, indi-
cate that most farmers cannot afford not to use the power machinery
they are now using, but having it they profit much by using it on more
acres with more livestock. This suggests that the absorption, now under
way, of small farms by more nearly economic family-size units will con-
tinue to be increasingly larger in terms of acres, and much more so in
terms of output. Some of the absorption will, of course, also be by
larger than family-size farms, but little so far indicates that this will
be a large factor in the situation. Also offsetting this latter in part is the

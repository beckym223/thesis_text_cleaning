observation of a greater variety of historical experience, and a recognition
that any body of generalizations tends to reflect some limited
stretch of historical experience must force us to evaluate any theorypast
or present-in terms of its empirical contents and the consequent
limits of its applicability-a precept which naturally should also be
applied to the oversimplified generalizations contained in the present
paper.
My final comment relates to the directions in which further exploration
of the subject is likely to lead us. Even in this simple initial sketch,
findings in the field of demography were used and references to political
aspects of social life were made. Uncomfortable as are such ventures
into unfamiliar and perhaps treacherous fields, they can not and should
not be avoided. If we are to deal adequately with processes of economic
growth, processes of long-term change in which the very technological,
demographic, and social frameworks are also changing-and in ways
that decidedly affect the operation of economic forces proper-it is
inevitable that we venture into fields beyond those recognized in recent
decades as the province of economics proper. For the study of the economic
growth of nations, it is imperative that we become more familiar
with findings in those related social disciplines that can help us understand
population growth patterns, the nature and forces in technological
change, the factors that determine the characteristics and trends in
political institutions, and generally patterns of behavior of human
beings-partly as a biological species, partly as social animals. Effective
work in this field necessarily calls for a shift from market economics
to political and social economy.

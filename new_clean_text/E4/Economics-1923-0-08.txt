"a snare set up by the companies for the express purpose of deluding
workers into the belief that they have some protection" when in reality
they have none.
How is the issue affected in the case of public service industries when,
in the interest of continuous operation, the law prescribes standards
as to wages, hours, and working conditions that must be maintained,
creates boards or courts for enforcing these standards, and prohibits
the organized workers from joining in strikes to interrupt the con-
tinuous flow of the commodities or services vital to the public interest?
It is evident at once that prohibitions on the right to strike largely
neutralize the advantages which flow from trade union organization.
Realization of this fact goes far to explain the uncompromising hos-
tility of the officials of the American trade unions to any curtailment
of the right to strike. Officers of the railroad brotherhoods have long
realized that actual use of the strike weapon would arouse such a
storm of public disapproval that the strike would be bound to fail and
yet they insist on a retention of the nominal right to strike because
they realize how its withdrawal will weaken the force of their efforts
to maintain the full strength of their unions.
To illustrate the point, consider what a feeble appeal the national
organization of street railway employees is able to offer to men
employed by a traction company in Kansas now that they have been
prohibited by law from engaging in strikes and at the same time afford-
ed an opportunity to carry their demands for higher wages, shorter
hours, or improved conditions to the Kansas Industrial Court! The
national organization cannot even assist greatly in the efforts to
change this Kansas plan since it owes its existence to Kansan rather
than national legislation. On the other hand, the case for organiza-
tion into company unions can be presented with convincing force by a
Kansas traction company which really wishes to establish better rela-
tions with its employees and through their intelligent co√∂peration to
afford more economical and efficient service to the Kansas public.
Through their joint efforts the employees organized in a company
over trade unions they are at the same time just as actively enforcing a series
of vicious practices that hamstring such organizations and render them useless to
**their employees;
"Whereas, in view of the foregoing facts it is evident that company unions
are unqualified to represent the interests of the workers, and that they are a de-
lusion and a snare set up by the companies for the express purpose of deluding
workers into the belief that they have some protection and thus have no need for
trade organizations;
"Therefore be it
"Resolved that we disapprove and condemn all such company unions and advise
our membership to have nothing to do with them and be it further
"Resolved that we demand the right to bargain collectively through the only
kind of organization fitted for this purpose, the trade union."**

indicator which will promptly measure and thus help to regulate the
fluctuations of business and government enterprise. They may, in their
historical section, be reporting on such imperfect but hopeful beginnings
as we are making in our statistical laboratories, our surveys of economic
and social changes, and our Presidential conferences. But we cannot
imagine what kind of ordered world these our successors will be living
in, or how far in the rhythm of history the existing tendency to control
and stability may be carried. Will they still be discovering new merits
in the medieval ideals of the just price and of equality of social oppor-
tunity? Or will a reaction have set in against an over-development of
the planned national economy and its neo-cameralistic economics?
However uncertain the future, of one thing we may now be fairly sure;
as the tides of world history are now moving, each ebb and flow enlarges
progressively the knowledge obtainable from the human record. From
the imperfections of the social sciences will ultimately emerge more per-
fect guides to social controls.

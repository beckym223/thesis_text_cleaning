One of the most significant recent developments in the labor organ-
ization field has been the multiplication of what are variously called
shop committees, works councils, or company unions. First established
in this country by the government labor boards to meet the war
emergency, shop committees might well have been expected to dwindle
and die after the boards creating them had been dissolved. Many of them
of course did so, but many more new committees have been organized.
According to the survey of the National Industrial Conference Board
the number of company unions or "works councils" in the United
States increased from two hundred and twenty-five in August, 1919,
to seven hundred and twenty-five in February, 1922. This was in spite
of the disappearance of fully one hundred of the councils which were
in existence when the war ended. To appreciate fully the significance
of this development we must contrast it with the course of trade union-
ism in the same period. During the two years 1920 to 1922 the
affiliated membership of the American Federation of Labor decreased
by more than 800,000 or over twenty per cent.
It is my purpose to consider the advantages and disadvantages of
these two types of labor organizations, company unions and trade
unions, from the viewpoint of the public interest, the interest of the
employees and the interest of employers. Our experience with company
unions is so recent that any discussion of them must be in part specu-
lative. To make my treatment as definite as the nature of the problem
permits, I shall limit myself to this issue in relation to public service
industries. Conclusions reached in this narrow field will admittedly be
inapplicable or only partly applicable to competitive industries, but
at this stage of our progress intensive analysis should be more useful

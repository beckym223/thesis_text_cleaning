at the too-low valuation. In other words, a too-low valuation of any
factor in the tables would be certain to cause a deficit in the stock of
that factor. Surplus or deficit-one or the other of these would result
from every wrong valuation of a factor.
From the above analysis it seems certain that the authorities of our
socialist state would have no difficulty finding out whether the standard
valuation of any particular factor was too high or too low. And this
much having been learned, the rest would be easy. Those authorities
would now proceed to lower valuations which had proved too high and
raise those which had proved too low. Finally, they would have no
difficulty repeating this process until neither a surplus nor a deficit ap-
peared, when they would rightly conclude that the valuation which was
then attached to any particular factor correctly expressed the effective
importance of that factor. It follows that we can now feel assured that
said authorities would be able to compute the resources-cost of produc-
ing any kind of commodity which the citizen might demand. But, since
the doubt on this point formed the principal ground for questioning the
soundness of the main contention of this paper, I find myself disposed
to affirm rather dogmatically that, if the economic authorities of a
socialist state would recognize equality between cost of production on
the one hand and the demand price of the buyer on the other as being
the adequate and the only adequate proof that the commodity in ques-
tion ought to be produced, they could, under all ordinary conditions,
perform their duties, as the persons who were immediately responsible
for the guidance of production, with well-founded confidence that they
would never make any other than the right use of the economic resources
placed at their disposal.

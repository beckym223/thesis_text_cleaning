Short and Long View in Economic Policy

the unemployment, governments should point with pride to their lusty
and bouncing deficits, instead of apologizing for them or shamefacedly
concealing them as if they were born out of wedlock, the long view tells
me that while this may not be the road to ruin it at least blazes a trail to
it. It must not be forgotten that spending in itself is for the spenders the
supreme pleasure, is the politicians' delight, and that what temperance in
resort to it has prevailed in the past has been wholly due to the belief that
somebody, some day, would have to be taxed to pay the bills. Even if this
belief were properly to be regarded as completely a myth, it would still be
one of the large class of highly useful myths.
Two related theses of the liberal tradition in Anglo-American thought
have been: first, that under a system of free individual enterprise a higher
level of economic well-being was attainable than under any other form of
economic organization; and second, that a society organized on this
economic basis was the only one compatible with the maintenance of
political democracy. These, of course, are dogmas, not axioms, one eco-
nomic and the other political in nature. Now that political democracy is
under attack, frankly from the fascist right and as menacingly though not
as frankly from the communist left which, like the serpent, licks its victim
over before it swallows it, the political dogma has become increasingly
acceptable even to those who reject the economic dogma. My concern
here, however, is only with the economic dogma, whose acceptability has
been destroyed or seriously impaired even for many economists by ten years
of sustained and severe depression.
There are perhaps some economists who would deny that an individual-
istic system is at all desirable economically. This view I will not discuss,
since even if I were to reject a substantially individualistic system on
economic grounds, I should still prefer it, on non-economic grounds, to
what seems to me to be its only practicable alternative, a comprehensively-
planned economy under which, as some one has said, "All our hairs would
be numbered, and all gray." There are many, however, who hold the view
that while a system of free individual enterprise would be ideal if attain-
able, it is no longer possible in these modern days of great concentration of
ownership and control of productive facilities, where the economic units
are to a large extent huge corporations and trade unions rather than the
single individuals of traditional economic theory, and where such com-
petition as persists tends increasingly to be competition between giants
instead of the atomistic competition of orthodox theory, and therefore to
be cost-raising rather than price-reducing.
When, some four or five generations ago, freedom of private initiative
was first systematically advocated as the ideal basis for an economic sys-
tem, the menace of monopoly to the proper working of a system so organized

There are equally evident weaknesses; the waste involved in competition;
the inequality of opportunity and bargaining power, due
to the unequal distribution of wealth, which tends to the formation
of economic classes and leaves potential capacity undeveloped;
the conflict over the distribution of the product of industry and
the consequent sense of opposition of interests between those upon
whose hearty co√∂peration the efficiency of industry depends; the
opportunity to gain wealth through the suppression of competition
and the establishing of monopoly rather than by economic
service; the more or less haphazard character of our industrial adjustments,
involving waste and giving rise to alternating periods
of prosperity and depression; the lack of motive in the present
generation for safeguarding the interests of future generations;
this is but a partial list of weaknesses long recognized.
That much has been done to eliminate these weaknesses and mitigate
their evil results I have no thought of denying, but, unfortunately
or not, neither individuals nor nations are inclined to
face the serious problems of life until they are forced upon them;
and it may be truly said that those who have had a controlling
voice in our industrial affairs and have prospered most under the
existing system have been content to let matters drift so far as
the most serious problems of industrial organization are concerned.


There is nothing new in the fact that great masses of men in all
countries are dissatisfied with the structure and working of the
existing economic system; what is new, what the experience of
the war has made clear, is that with the extension of the suffrage,
education, and organization, these masses have acquired a definiteness
of purpose and a power which compels a thoroughgoing consideration
and possible reconstruction of our industrial system, if
its stability is to be preserved.

Amid the flood of radical proposals which abound in a period
of world disorganization such as the present it is doubtless easy to
exaggerate the strength of the tendency to fundamental changes
in our social system. Those who are agitating for change are
articulate and insistent, but it is difficult to estimate the power
by which they are backed in comparison with the inertia of the
less articulate masses of the population. It would be foolish, however,
to close our eyes to the possibility of radical changes in our
industrial structure. Our economic system is exempt from change

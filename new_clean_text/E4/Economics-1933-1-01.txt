AMERICAN TRADE UNIONISM AND SOCIAL INSURANCE
Presidential address delivered at the Forty-fifth Annual Meeting of the American
Economic Association, Cincinnati, Ohio, December 29, 1932.
The past ten years have seen changes of amazing magnitude in the
organization of American economic society. It is of one of these funda-
mental alterations that I wish to speak this evening. There are doubtless
other changes of a more spectacular kind, but I doubt whether any other
is of more permanent import, both in practical results and in theoretical
interest. The change to which I refer is the lessening importance of
trade unionism in American economic organization.
I have recently compiled the statistical material relating to the mem-
bership of American trade unions,¹ bringing down to 1930 the figures
which I had previously tabulated in 1914, covering the period from
1897 to 1914, and again in 1921, for the period from 1914 to 1921.²
The three studies taken together cover a period of over thirty years.
I have already explained in published articles the sources of the material.
The method used in the present study is identical with that of the
earlier compilations, and I shall not take time to describe it here.
The salient fact which emerges from these three studies may be briefly
stated. American trade unionism had always previously shown growth
in periods of prosperity. From 1897 to 1904, the membership increased
from a half million to two millions, quadrupling in seven years. The
movement had reached its end in the latter year and another forward
march did not begin until 1910. From that year until 1913 the mem-
bership increased nearly 50 per cent. The outbreak of the European
War brought a slight recession; but in 1915 the upward movement was
resumed, and from 1915 to 1920 the membership doubled, reaching in
1920 a total of nearly five millions. Undoubtedly a large part of this
gain in membership was ephemeral, and it was to be expected that a
considerable falling off would follow. By 1924 the membership had
dropped to three and three-quarter millions. It is the years from 1924

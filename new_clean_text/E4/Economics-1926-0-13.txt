rehabilitation of Austria, Hungary and Germany is that they embody
international agreements. The securing of these international agree-
ments was both a more difficult and a more important achievement
than the formulating of the particular economic remedies that were to
be administered. It is easier to determine what economic precedure is
wise than it is to change national attitudes.
In these instances the changing of national attitudes was achieved
by organizing and giving expression to the common interests of nations.
The hopelessness of other methods had to be shown before this could
be accomplished, but once done, it is not easily undone. The new
attitude creates a new interest. Even if some of its economic pro-
visions should break down, as is altogether likely, the Dawes plan
probably will have solved the reparation problem.
The significance of these achievements for the general problem which
I have undertaken to discuss is obvious. The attitudes and activities
which we have in mind when we speak of "the economic causes of war‚Äù
are not inevitable and unyielding expressions of permanent traits of
human nature. They are forms or patterns of conduct and are
correlated with particular modes of organization. Other forms and
patterns, associated with other modes of organization, are within the
bounds of practicable achievement. This does not mean that the task
is simple, or that it can be accomplished merely by finding a magic
formula. Nor does any sensible person expect that sectional interests
or international economic antagonisms will disappear. But it is not
unreasonable to hope that some day they may be subordinated to new
and larger interests which will grow out of new forms of organization.
At any rate, the only way to secure economic peace is to turn our eyes
toward it.

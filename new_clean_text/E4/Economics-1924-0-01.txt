Economists have found income difficult to define. Professor Irving
Fisher in his book on The Nature of Capital and Income, published as
late as 1906, characterizes economic opinion regarding the nature of
income as "deplorably confused and conflicting." Professor Seligman,
writing in 1911, said: "The problem of defining income...... is one
that almost baffles the student.”³ Still more recently, 1921, the staff
of the National Bureau of Economic Research said, with reference to
income statistics, that "one of the most serious difficulties in working
with these data is the difficulty of definition," and supported that statement
by propounding a long series of unanswered riddles concerning
income.*

Yet, so far as my observation goes, most other people think they
know what income is. Many, to be sure, acknowledge difficulty in
correlating their ideas of income with the requirements of an incometax
return. This difficulty may be attributed to the peculiarities in
the statutory definition of taxable income, to the whimsicalities of a
bureaucracy, or, possibly, to a natural reluctance to pay any tax.
For the tears which a tax incites dim the vision. But the man on the
street, until pressed to define income or sharply catechized as to whether
this or that item is income or not, is more or less amused at the suggestion
that he may not know what his income is. The testimony of a
vast preponderance of witnesses would, I imagine, be that income is a
very definite concept, of which it should be possible to frame an acceptable
definition.

Income is certainly one of the most fundamental concepts in the
science of economics and to clarify its definition, be it to ever so small
an extent, is worth while in itself. But in choosing this subject for
this occasion I have had another purpose in mind. That purpose was
to illustrate the desirability of a more intensive study than has heretofore

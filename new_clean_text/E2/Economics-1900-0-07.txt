company of hypocrites and pharisees. He will be a
more efficient reformer if he claims a little less for his
mission and can get those lesser claims recognized, than
if he claims everything and gets no recognition at all.
We are further told that whether he be considered
a hypocrite or not, he will be entitled a visionary,
and justly so. The general public whose interests he
represents is not a working political force. Its interests
are so vague and remote that there is no means of getting
them recognized in the concrete work of legislation
and of government. You must appeal to localities
and to classes. Localities have their representatives,
classes have their organs. Each locality and each class
has its public sentiment, which in one way or another
is a living power in politics. This existence of a coherent
public opinion and of a definite interest is a necessary
condition for the social reformer, who would be
more than a pure theorist. The one is his material, the
other is his tool. No man, however great, can hope to
accomplish his results with neither tools nor materials
ready to his hand. Even if you believe yourself wholly
disinterested you must appeal to classes and secure the
partial good which is attainable, rather than aim at the
greater good which from the outset you are fated to miss.
They tell us further that this view of the matter represents
not only practical politics but practical ethics.
Life in a modern free community is an interaction and
interplay between the several members of that community.
Each individual is working for ends of his own,
distinct from those of other individuals. Each class
has standards and ideals of its own, differing from those
of other classes. Civil liberty is but a recognition of
these differences-permission to the various members of
the state to pursue their own several ends under the protection

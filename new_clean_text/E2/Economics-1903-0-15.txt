our part. But with every decade's progress in science
the conditions will change, and the old nationalism of
exclusiveness will melt into the new cosmopolitanism
based upon the continual progress of each great and
economically homogeneous community.
The fourth characteristic of the modern age is the
development of the competitive régime. This needs
but little more than a mention. Several of the former
presidents of this Association have made you familiar
with the real meaning of competition. They have
pointed out that a competition of the right kind is a
necessity to social progress—that progress consists not
in doing away with competition but in raising it to a
higher plane; not in suppressing it, but in preserving
and extending it, while substituting a loyal for a disloyal
rivalry. What often seems to be the crushing of
competition is in reality the replacing of a lower by a
higher form. The trade-union movement, for instance,
with the progress from individual to collective bargaining,
seems from one point of view to lessen competition,
but no one who understands the real philosophy of the
movement can doubt for a moment that on the whole it
makes for a truer and more perfect competition based
on the equality of the contending forces. The trust
seems to be the very negation of competition, and yet if
the conditions of loyal and healthy enterprise are insisted
upon, and the trust be not permitted to take advantage
of a legal code lagging behind the economic
development, the net results of the movement may well
prove to be the sloughing off of the evils of a lower
competition and the attainment of a higher form of
emulation.
It is precisely here that the force of the fifth factor

student's interest in the subject, and the knowledge of
its wider bearings might well lighten the burden of its
routine, as well as sharpen the intellect in its pursuit,
and in so far qualify the candidate for even the more
technical sides of the work.
As to the third objection on the part of college men,
that there is no well recognized curriculum which can
with a good conscience be recommended to a young man
as likely to qualify him better for his business life, we
must admit that this proposition has been true down to a
comparatively recent period, and is even yet in large measure
true. But this has been the case in the early history.
of all professional and technical study. Compare the
curriculum of the law school at Harvard to-day with
that of the first law school in the country, or the present
medical school in Harvard with the beginning of this
school a century ago, or present day technical training
with the curriculum for the first schools of technology.
We have not, it must be admitted, worked out as yet
any body of doctrine or group of studies, theoretical or
practical, which will compare favorably with the system
applied to law, medicine, theology or engineering.
But we have at least the beginning of such a curriculum,
and, even, as it is, a course worth the while of young
men to take who desire to learn something of the history
and wider bearings of their future callings; indeed,
something which it is worth their while to take as a
mere element in a liberal education, if nothing else.
And in any case, we must begin at some time to work
out such a curriculum, and why not now as well as ever?
But the present remarkable development has come
about not only because our colleges and universities
have begun to reach out, driven by the law of their own
internal development, to enter this new and unoccupied

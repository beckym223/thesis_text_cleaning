Henry C. Adams, will I trust not think that any betrayal
of confidence is involved when I recall his statement that
the great difficulty with which he had to contend, when
writing his admirable work on the Science of Finance,
was the well-nigh insuperable task of making his conclusions,
drawn from the theory of ability, of any practical
avail when dealing with our specific problems.
And if we could analyze the thought of many members
of this audience, I am confident that my distinguished
predecessor is not by any means the only one who has
been forcibly struck by this fact. The theoretical conclusions
all seem to point one way, and the possibility
of practical application the other. In fact, if I may be
pardoned for sounding a personal note, it was this yawning
gulf, this gaping hiatus between theory and application
which prevented me from publishing several years
ago the results of a protracted study on the Income Tax.
I did not then understand that the difficulty is far more
deep-rooted, and that the disparity is due not to any
doctrine of faculty, but to the underlying individual
basis of the accepted theory of finance.
Not only are the conclusions of the generally received
doctrine inapplicable to our condition, butâ€”and here we
come to the second remarkable fact-the recent history
of American taxation seems to be in flat contradiction
to the very foundations of the theory. Equality and
universality of taxation are accepted as the corner-stones
of the faculty theory. How then shall we explain the
indubitable fact that our general property tax is disappearing,
that personalty is slipping out of the assessment
lists, and that in all our great industrial centers at least,
real estate has come to bear well nigh the exclusive
burden. Where are the equality and the universality of
that practice? How shall we explain the fact that while.

Economics and Social Progress

stake of principle and to hold fast to the sheet anchor of
unprejudiced and undaunted conclusion. The so-called
theorist has a heavy and often undeserved load to bear.
The term is redolent of condescension; it smacks of con-
tempt. And yet, if the theory is what the word implies,
if it is a real exposition, a true statement of the neces-
sary relations between facts, then no matter by what
method it has been reached, no matter how unlikely it
may seem or how unwelcome it may be, it rests upon a
bed of adamant and will endure forever. To seek such
an explanation, to attain such a result needs not only
the most unremitting ardor, but often the most intrepid
resolution.
The point, however, that it is desired to emphasize
here is that the facts of which an explanation is sought
must be chosen with discrimination. If the facts them-
selves are really insignificant, the theory, no matter how
true, cannot fail to be trivial. The minor writers on
economics have, unfortunately, far too often dissipated
their energies on such trivialities, and have, as a conse-
quence, sunk to the depths of scholasticism and mere
logomachy. If economics is to be of any real service, it
must deal with the important phenomena of economic
life. The great thinkers in our domain, however ele-
vated their view, however recondite their processes of
thought, have always stood on the firm foundation of
basic social relations. To whatever extent, for instance,
we may be tempted to disagree with the methods or the
conclusions of Ricardo, there is no doubt that the prob-

of so acute and so profound a mind. However abstract
the mode of treatment, however unfinished or fragment-
ary the results, however remote the argument from the
habitual and narrow considerations of the market place,

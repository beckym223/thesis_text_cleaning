Forty years ago, the doctrine of free trade seemed to
be triumphant, alike in the judgments of thinkers and
in the policy of the leading countries. The school of
Adam Smith and Ricardo had swept the board in Great
Britain, and its conclusions, as set forth in John Stuart
Mill's Principles, were thought to represent the defini-

the one most potent means of increasing the efficiency
of labor. In legislation, the triumph seemed to be no

direction of lower duties, had at last taken the sudden
plunge to free trade in the dramatic repeal of the corn
laws in 1846. Not long after, France, by the com-
mercial treaty of 1860 with England, had replaced the
old regime of rigid protection and prohibition by a sys-

of similar import between the various countries of
Europe, spreading over all the Continent a net-work of
reciprocal arrangements that greatly lowered the tariff
barriers in the civilized world. In the United States a
long period, from 1846 to 1861, had witnessed a marked
relaxation of the protective system; and if the civil war
had brought a return to high duties, this might be

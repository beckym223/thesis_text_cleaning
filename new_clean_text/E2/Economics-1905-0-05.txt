Present Position of the Doctrine of Free Trade 33
aspects of the theory of international trade quite beyond
the ken of those who expound the virtues of protection
to the general public. Here the exports are not re-
garded as the means of buying the imports: the exports
are good per se, the imports bad per se. We may apply to
this sort of talk a well-known passage of Adam Smith's:
"Some of the best English writers upon commerce set

ties somehow slip out of their memory, and all their
talk is of gaining by sales and of losing by purchase, of
the great glories of swelling exports, and the ill omen

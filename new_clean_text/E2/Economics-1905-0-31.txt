for labor, and not least the effects of restrictions in the
way of taxes, on all these topics the old doctrines have
never been seriously shaken. Qualifications of one sort
and another, deviations from the regime of freedom
such as Adam Smith himself conspicuously enumerated,
-contingencies under which commercial blows may be
so planted as to convert an opponent into an allyâ€”these
have long been admitted. Certain refined and ingenious
trains of reasoning have been brought forward, too, of late
years, regarding the effects of protective duties on the
distribution of wealth and on the ultimate elements of
social well-being. They connect themselves with some
of the more recent speculations in economic theory at
large. Like these, they have had no effect, as yet at
least, outside the small fringe of scholars and teachers,
and no very marked effect even within that fringe. A
discussion of them would carry this address far beyond
the permissible limits. At best, they suggest only still
further qualifications and still other possible exceptions,
and they leave intact the core of the classic theory of
international trade. That theory, in its essentials, holds
its own without a serious rival.
This being the case among the thinkers, the question
naturally arises as to how it happens that the opposite
theory, or at least the policy based on a very different
theory, holds its own in the field of legislation.
consideration, however brief, must be given to this ques-
tion in any inquiry as to the present position of the doc-
trine of free trade.

There is no one explanation of the strong hold which

tain. The effectiveness of its appeal to the every-day
man has already been noted. The arguments about
employment, labor, domestic industry, home markets.

We grasp the form, but not the substance. We think
that we appreciate the social basis of economic law, but
in reality our appreciation is fragmentary. We do the
theory lip-service, but not brain-homage. We are obli-

in reality erroneous, or at least impotent to explain
modern tendencies or to afford any satisfactory clue to
the solution of modern difficulties. By their fruits shall

This is a severe and comprehensive indictment. You

the very conception of right and wrong, so far as it is of
human origin at all, is the product of social, not of in-
dividual, forces. The weakness of the early utilitarian

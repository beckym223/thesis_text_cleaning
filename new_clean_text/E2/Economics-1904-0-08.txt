in the development of Roman life. On the other hand,
the theory as elaborated by the philosophers, and tacitly
accepted by the people, of recent centuries is the labor
theory. We pride ourselves on the advance that has been
made. The Romans seized their property, so it is said;
we earn our property: the one is a brutal doctrine; the
other a moral doctrine.
And yet, half uneasily, half regretfully, we are beginning
to realize that things are not quite so simple; that
the labor theory does not exactly fit into the facts of
modern life. In truth, the labor theory, like the occupation
theory, is deficient because it looks at the individual,
instead of the social, element. Take for example
our modern problem of irrigation. The English common
law conception of private property-the property
that reaches, as has been drastically said, from heaven
to hellâ€”is a product of a moist climate-of conditions
where there is an abundance-nay, even a superabundance
of water, and where private interest could be
safely depended upon to give the best results. But in
the arid and semi-arid regions of our western empire,
neither occupation nor labor is deemed to give an equitable
title to the river or the adjacent riparian lands.
The new code of private property which is springing up
in the West is one in which the individual rights are
clearly and forcibly held subservient to those of the
community.
What is true of irrigable land in the West is true in
varying degree of many forms of private property in the
East. May I not do as it listeth me with my own," is a
cry far less frequently heard than of old. Private property
as a concept will no doubt always remain with us;
bnt the content of the concept is changing and has
changed from the beginning of civilization. Property

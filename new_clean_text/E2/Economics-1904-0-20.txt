The same analysis might be applied to all the other
forms of taxation. To keep our eyes riveted on the in-
dividual taxpayer will only lead us astray.
A new light is thus thrown on the distinction between.
real and personal taxes. The books tell us that personal
taxes are bad because they are inquisitorial. This is
undoubtedly true. But tax reformers nevertheless advo-
cate personal taxes, because they think that in this way
alone can individual justice be secured. They fail to
realize that under modern economic conditions the only
kind of a personal tax which can be made to rest on the
individual is a poll tax, or a direct consumption tax,
both of which all agree in condemning. Under the
highly complex competitive conditions of to-day, the
general property tax becomes in practice a partial
property tax, or a tax on certain kinds of property,
irrespective of the question of individual ownership.
Under modern conditions a general income tax which is
presumed to reach with accuracy the ability of each in-
dividual becomes in practice either what the Germans
call a Lug- und Trug System, a "lie and cheat system,"
with the burden primarily on the classes unable to pay;
or, as in England and her colonies, a series of imposts
not on the persons who receive the income, but on the
property which yields the income, or on the corporation
or the employer who pays the income. In neither case
is there any assurance of equivalence between the
amount of the tax and the ability of the recipient of the
income.
If we recollect that in the ultimate working out of
economic law there is no such distinction between real and
personal taxes, but that the difference is simply one of
administration and not of essence, our attitude to the
whole problem is changed and our opinion as to the ethical

proved the existence of unexpected power and resource.
It is probably no accident that the ensuing years
showed a spirit of daring in industry, and sudden and
successful activity in commercial enterprises.
No one is more opposed than I am to all that goes
with war and militarism. It is with reluctance that I
bring myself to admit that the same spirit which leads
to success in war, may also lead to success in the arts
of peace.
Yet so it seems to be. Men being what

communicates itself by imitation and emulation, and
shows itself in all the manifestations of its activity. A
great war lifts the minds of men to large undertakings,

We are in danger of straying far from our subject.
Yet the digressions to which the argument for protec-

The Tide of Economic Thought.

In the strict sense, the title Mr. George and his party
have adopted, is a misnomer. The assumption by the
State, for its own uses, of the economic rent of land,
does really not constitute a tax at all. It is merely
the exercise of one of the lucrative prerogatives of the
State. Properly speaking, as I esteem it, (1) some-
thing of the idea of contribution according to ability
to pay; (2) something of the notion of universality

thing of an expectation that the burden will, in the
end, be spread, more or less imperfectly, over the
whole community, on whomsoever it in the first
instance falls, underlie every real tax.
But in the case of "the confiscation of rent by
taxation," to use Mr. George's expression, the right
of the State to make the exaction is not put at all

his controversy with Dr. Seligman, before the Social
Science Association at Saratoga, last summer, Mr.
George argued strongly against the notion of contri-
bution according to ability.
Again, in the Single Tax there is no pretence of
universality of exaction. The subject taken for im-
position is single, specific; and no citizen is assessed.

necessary purposes that which otherwise the indi-
vidual would have a perfect right to enjoy. To the
contrary of this, it is asserted that the individual
has no right whatever to "the unearned increment"
of the soil of which he may be in possession; that,

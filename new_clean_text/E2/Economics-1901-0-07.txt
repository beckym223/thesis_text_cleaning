see that co-operation and the ability to co-operate are
powerful weapons, even in the competitive sub-human
struggle for existence.ยน
We must hasten on to the point where, as a result of
organic evolution, we have the emergence of man.
Among primitive men competition seems at first to
take on more cruel forms than among animals. But if
evolution has apparently gone back a few steps, it is
only to move forward mightily and unceasingly as
social evolution for the achievement of ends whose
grandeur we as yet but faintly apprehend. Competition,
begun far below man with the very beginnings of life,
persists as one of the most fundamental laws of animate
existence, but evolution carries it to higher and ever
higher planes. Primitive competition includes a narrow
circle of association and, beyond that, slaughter for
economic advantage. With social evolution slaughter
gradually recedes into the background and falls below
competition into the region of crime. When men con-
sidered it dishonorable to gain by the sweat of the brow
what could be won by the sword, battle belonged to
economic competition; not so in the age of industry.
From early times, and until recently, the competitive
social order found within its frame-work a place for
slavery; but as a result of social evolution, continued
for ages, slavery falls below the plane of competition
and is now regarded as incompatible with civilization.
Piracy, until a comparatively recent period of the
world's history, held an honorable place within the

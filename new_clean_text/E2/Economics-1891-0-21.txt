The Tide of Economic Thought.

Now, is the republic in any way threatened by
immigration as at present going forward? During
the ten years ending July 1, 1890, five millions and
a quarter of foreigners arrived upon our shores.
This is twice the number ever before arriving in one
decade. No reason is known why the arrivals of
the next ten years may not equal those of 1880-90 ;
may not, indeed, exceed them as greatly as these
exceeded the arrivals of 1870-80.
The continent of Europe, away back to the plains
of Hungary, Poland, and Russia, is now so completely
crossed by railways, the organization of the emigra-
tion service is every where so perfect, the capabilities
of the ocean fleets are so enormous, that, alike the
time, the money and the amount of mental energy
and enterprise required have been reduced to a point
which puts it within the power of tens of millions of
peasants, in the most miserable conditions of life, to
remove themselves to the New World. Even in the
depths of the Austrian Tyrol, and in remote villages
of Bohemia, are found the agents of railway com-
panies and steamship companies, who put emigration
into the heads of the peasantry; who assist the intend-
ing emigrants to dispose of their little effects, buy
their tickets for them, put them and their baggage
into the cars and lock them in, consigned to the agent
of the proper steamship company at Bremen, Ham-
burg, or Antwerp. Upon arrival at the port, the
emigrants are let out of the cars by steamship
officials, taken to warehouses where they lay them-
selves and their bundles on the floor until the ship
is ready to sail. In New York, again, they are met
by agents, put into cars and dispatched to their new
homes.

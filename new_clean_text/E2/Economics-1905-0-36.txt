balancing of conflicting principles. The question of
principle is none the less important, and important for
practical purposes. He who is convinced that the use
of alcoholic liquors is overwhelmingly harmful may hes-
itate, in the world as it is, whether to favor absolute pro-
hibition, or government management, or private trade
under license and control. Yet, if he has the question
of principle clearly settled in his mind, he will combat
steadfastly popular errors about healthful effects of alco-
hol, and will welcome every promising device towards
checking its use. He who believes that war is evil and
wasteful, and militarism preponderantly bad in its spirit
and effect, may regretfully admit that armies and navies
must be maintained, and much labor misapplied in the
making and using of instruments of destruction. Yet
he will oppose every unnecessary increase of armament,
avoid every occasion for rousing others to rivalry in
warlike preparation, and welcome every opportunity for
the peaceful settlement of disputes between nations. So
he who believes that international trade is but one form,
and no peculiar form, of the division of labor, and that,
like all division of labor, it is preponderantly beneficial
in its effects, may admit that its application in a given
country raises problems not to be disposed of by mere
appeal to this principle alone. Some of the qualifica-
tions have been considered in what has preceded; and
others will readily occur to you, such as the demands of
public revenue, a needful regard for vested interests, the
political and social effects of trade within the country
aud without. But in considering any question of con-
crete commercial policy, it is necessary first to know
whether a restriction on foreign trade is presumably a
cause of gain or loss. Is a protective tariff something
to be regretted, for which an offset is to be sought in

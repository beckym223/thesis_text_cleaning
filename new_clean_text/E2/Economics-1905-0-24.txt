against international competition. Some have been
quite independent of this stimulus, the question being
not whether they would spring up within the country,
but where within the country,-whether along the seaboard
or in the interior. In either case, the full competition
of the older regions of our own country has
been felt by the newer regions. The diversification of
the newer regions has nevertheless proceeded smoothly
and steadily. That diversification continues and will
continue, notwithstanding the most absolute free trade
throughout our own borders. No artificial fostering as
against the manufactures of the East has been possible:
though, if possible, it would doubtless have been asked.
Yet the growth of manufactures in the Central region
has been perhaps the most striking change in the industrial
structure of the country during the last generation.

These familiar facts must make us hesitate before ascribing
to legislative interposition too much effect on
the development of new industries or on the general
course of economic progress. I have already referred to
the difficulty of disentangling the complex forces that
bear on economic progress, and will not pretend to offer
anything in the way of proof for what I have further to
offer as to the relative weight of different factors.
Briefly stated, my belief is that the general structure
and spirit of the social body are much more important
than specific encouragement to this or that industry,
Any detailed statement of the grounds of this opinion
would carry us into fields much more speculative than
those which have been considered in the preceding
pages; and it must suffice to illustrate rather than support
it from a brief conisderation of some aspects of
social and economic history.

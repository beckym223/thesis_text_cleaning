on a principle of separate pursuits of selfish interests;
and although there will be some aggregate loss through
the preference of local interests to general ones, there is
likely to be at least a relative fairness when each member
of the federation is strong enough to secure its own
share of the plunder and to protect itself from undue
imposition. But when we come to administer the affairs
of a weaker nation to which we do not and cannot give
political autonomy, the evils of the old system become
so obvious and the need of ideals in politics becomes so
exacting that even those who in their past public life
have scoffed at the conception of a higher law than their
own selfishness, are, under the new conditions. compelled
by very shame to appeal to such a higher law.
The more completely our undertakings, whether private
or public, industrial or political, take the character of
trusts, the more impossible does it become for those who
are placed in authority to represent personal or class interests
without gross violation of what we, in our everyday
life, recognize as fundamental dictates of sympathy
or of justice.
If it were true that each man's mental horizon were
bounded by his class interests; if the man who claimed
to look beyond them were sure to be regarded as a hypocrite
and were likely to be abused as self-deluded; if we
were constitutionally inaccessible to any political motives
higher than those of rational egoism; this would
simply mean that we were fundamentally unfit for the
task that is before us. It would mean that the trusts
which were placed in the hands of our citizens by the
new conditions of business and of politics, were of a
kind which we could not fulfil. It would indicate that
the largeness of our problems would ruin us morally
and politically, as Rome was ruined by her imperial

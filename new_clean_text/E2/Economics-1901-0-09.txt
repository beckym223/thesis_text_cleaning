loosely formed groups of employers pursuing common
purposes; and also groups of workingmen likewise
seeking to promote common interests. Again we no-
tice a permanent organization of labor on the one hand
and of capital on the other. Then we discover political
associations embracing within themselves an infinite
variety of competitive groups; and these political asso-
ciations themselves having competitive features extend
from the small hamlet to the mighty nation. But com-
petition does not stand alone. With it are associated
sympathy, benevolence, and public authority. More-
over, wisely directed humanitarianism strengthens each
group, while ruthless selfishness among the members of
the group gradually destroys power in competition.
The larger the competitive group, the wider becomes
the sphere for generosity, the larger the safe scope of
pity, and the milder may the competition become for
the individual. Witness how the progress of modern
nations in philanthropy attends growing efficiency in
their economic struggles. International competition is
a stern fact of our time. Is it not equally a fact that
the most potent nations in this great dramatic world-
wide struggle of interests are precisely those nations in
which we find the highest individual and social de-
velopment of altruism? Association and co√∂peration,
the healing touch, benevolence, love, are all compatible
with competition.
Fear has sometimes been expressed lest the humani-
tarian side of social evolution should lead to weakness
and degeneration, and the world be converted into
Goethe's vast hospital. Such apprehension, I believe,
does not rest upon a critical analysis of the forces at
work in modern civilization. It is true that benevo-
lence, manifested in and through progress, may keep
alive some weak individuals, who in a harsher age

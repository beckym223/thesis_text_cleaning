faced squarely in even a partial treatment of the subject;
and it is not creditable to our legislation that it should
have been satisfied with the absurd result just pointed out.
It is hardly possible that the renewed resort to taxation
upon declaration, under a law of the United States, should
not have some effect on the current of opinion which has
been so long gathering in opposition to the analogous practice
of State taxation of personal property. The wide
recognition of the failure of the local practice has already
been referred to. There has been for some years past an
increasing disposition in many States to find some substitute
for this ineffective and obsolete system. What will
be the effect of the adoption by the United States of the
same practice of grasping at the intangible? Will it
encourage or dishearten the movement for local reform, or
will the movement pause until the issue of the new
experiment is seen? We shall be fortunate if it proves
that the United States have not interposed some serious
delay in the progress of a change, not likely to be too
rapid at the best.
The only remaining feature of the act of 1894 which we
have to consider is the provision by which the tax is, for
the most part, to be levied annually on the income, not of
the current year, but of the year preceding. This is a
natural, although not a necessary application of the system
of levying upon declared income. In theory the accounts.
of the tax-payer for a year are made up and closed. He
knows to a penny what his income was; and it is the
simplest of financial operations to calculate 2 per cent.
of the amount, and in due time to pay down this tax.
So long, indeed, as the law proceeds on the theory of an
exact determination of the income to be taxed, it is hard
to see how anything but the income of a finished year can
be dealt with. And yet it is probably more convenient
for the tax-payer that his tax should come as a deduction

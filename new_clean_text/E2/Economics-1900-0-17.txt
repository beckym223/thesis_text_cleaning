But I have faith to
believe that this is not the fate marked out for us to-day.
I believe that the American people and the modern civ-
ilized world in general will solve these problems, as they
have solved other problems which have come up in the
successive phases of their history; that we shall meet
the new collective needs of industry and government
with a true collectivism of spirit and purpose. Not
with that superficial collectivism or socialism which,
like the individualism that it strives to supersede, often
makes too much of mere political machinery, and be-
lieves that men are to be saved by their institutions.
rather than their characters; but with a public spirit
which demands, as a part of the national ethics, that
men shall shape their course on the basis of conviction
rather than of compromise, and that public discussion
shall look toward a common understanding rather than
a bargain. Because the political and commercial meth-
ods of the past have led to compromise rather than con-
viction, or because the successful man of affairs must be
ready to compromise where he fails to convince, let us
not, say that all politics and all commerce is but a tissue
of compromises, and that a political or commercial
science which pretends to be something broader and
better than this, is an illusion. Let us as economists
take the opportunity that lies before us, in the face of
new conditions for whose treatment the old methods are
proving themselves inadequate. Let us employ our un-
derstanding with regard to public needs as a means of
evoking public spirit. Let us use whatever special
knowledge we have with all the breadth of purpose
which it is in our power to attain, and make ourselves,
as becomes men of science, representatives of nothing.

At our meeting a year ago, I had the honor to address
this Association on the relations between economics and
politics. At that time I sought to indicate at once the
need of an increase of influence to be exerted by econo-
mists upon the political world, and the method by which
such increase might best be attained. On the fact that
such a change was needed there seemed to be no differ-

to be accomplished there was much more diversity of
view. Certain members went so far as to regret that in
the brief time which was given for discussion no ade-
quate opportunity was afforded them to develop different,
and to some degree antagonistic, ideas, with regard to
the means to be pursued in order to increase the influ-
ence of the economist in modern political life. The
present address is in some sense a continuation of that
which was delivered a year ago. It is an endeavor to
expand more fully the argument on those points where
the members of the Association felt themselves most
doubtful. In its preparation I have been actuated
throughout by the desire to give the fullest opportunity
for the discussion of difficult questions; and I believe
that its chief value will lie in the stimulus which it gives

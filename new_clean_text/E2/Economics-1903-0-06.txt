economic conditions. The Puritans had nothing to do
with the beginnings of democracy in the medi√¶val
communes, or with its development amid the Alps of
Switzerland or the dunes of Holland; and the same
Puritans were unable to put on a firm foundation at
home the democracy which they easily established in
the new world. So it is with the love of liberty and
individualism. Liberty is always the concomitant of
economic equality, or at all events of the equality of
economic opportunity. When this equality was almost
from the outset excluded, as in the South through the
pressure of an economic environment based on an
abundance of free soil, well suited to an extensive and
quasi-tropical tillage, the result was a disappearance of
liberty for all but the governing class. It took but a
few generations for the sturdy and liberty-loving patriots
of England and Scotland to become sincere and devoted
believers in the necessity and the beneficence of slavery.
The so-called Anglo-Saxon love of liberty went the
way of the old Roman boast of freedom when the world
conquests, with their supply of fresh land, made slavery
an economically profitable system. What a ghastly
mockery that the proud assertion in our Declaration of
Independence as to all men being born equal and with
the natural right to liberty should be signed by so large
a proportion of slaveholders!
And what shall we say of the boasted Anglo-Saxon in-
dividualism? How does it happen that the English-
man, leaving his moist and fertile home for the arid and
barren wastes of the antipodes, becomes, if not a social-
ist, at all events the next remove to one? Why is it
that in Australia we find the government railroads, and
the government insurance, and the government steam-
ship, and the government frozen meat industry, and the

Ricardo implicitly; in his theory of prosperity he
differed from him at every point. It was just because
he accepted so thoroughly one part of the Ricardian
economics that he was able to dissent so consistently
from the other, with a directness of opposition boru of
mutual understanding. It was because each assumed so
fully the existence of free competition, and carried out
that assumption so completely to certain of its logical
consequences, that this same power became a demigod
to the one and a demon to the other. In the words of
the poet,
"Both read the same books, day and night,
But thou readest black where I read white."
As far as a man's political economy takes the form of
a theory of distribution, it is not sure to be very closely
connected with his ethical principles, or even with his
political ones. In framing such a theory he is occupied
with tracing consequences from observed facts. His
political antecedents or his ethical prepossessions may
lead him to observe some facts more closely than others,
or to examine some parts of his chain of reasoning more
critically than other parts. But these variations, as
far as they exist, are errors, even from the man's own
standpoint, errors which he is interested in correcting
as soon as they can be brought clearly home to him.
He can say, in the words of Dunoyer, “Je n'impose rien,
je ne propose même rien: j'expose "-I am neither im-
pounder nor even propounder, but expounder. Nor do
his theories of distribution modify his ethics much more
than his ethics modify his theories of distribution; ex-
cept, perhaps, so far as the habitual assumption of a set
of facts and laws leads to the habitual assumption of the
rightness of those laws, morally as well as intellectually.

celebration, the chief purpose of the university or college
is not the imparting of information or the giving
of a special or technical training or the development of
scholars, but the securing of that breadth of view and
widened sympathy which is the result of the personal
intercourse of thousands of young men through a period
of three or four years under college and university influence,
how vastly will this influence for good in every
direction be strengthened and increased, when in addition
to the hundreds of young men in our colleges now
preparing for the professions we shall have other hundreds
preparing for commercial life. And this will surely
be the case if the universities recognize their duties
toward this great and growing class of our community.
If the business classes are destined to have an ever-increasing
influence in our society how necessary it is for
public welfare that as many members of these classes as
possible shall come under the influence, for a longer or
shorter time, of those great forces which make up our
modern university!

both beginning work in December, 1883. A new era was

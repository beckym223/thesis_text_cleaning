taxes on raw materials, that they accumulate as profits
are heaped up on them in the successive stages through
which the commodity passes before reaching the con-
sumers' hands. But this makes only a difference of
degree, and perhaps not a great difference of de-
gree, between raw materials and most manufactures ;
whereas, so far as the young industries argument goes,
there is a difference in kind. Nature has settled what
sorts of raw materials a country is fitted to produce. No
encouragement from protective duties, for example, can
so stimulate the growth of forests in the United States
as to bring us in the end cheaper timber. No such
stimulus can cause the climate of the country to become
better adapted for wool growing, or give it the peculiar
advantages which the interior of Australia has for this
form a pastoral industry; or make Louisiana as well
fitted for growing cane sugar as Cuba.
Nevertheless, it must be admitted that, even so far as
this special argument for protection is concerned, there
may be sometimes as good reason for duties on raw ma-
terials as on manufactures. Mining operations usually
involve an initial stage of experiment and uncertainty,
and almost always call for a heavy investment of fixed
capital. The history of the iron industry in the
United States and Germany, and possibly that of the
copper industry in the United States, suggest at least
the possibility that a stage of artificial and expensive
stimulus may be followed by an eventual attainment of
developed and cheapened production. Agriculture
seems to present such possibilities in less degree; pas-
toral industry still less; and forestry least of all.
Unlike most other parts of the controversy be-
tween free-trade and protection, the young industries
arguments connects itself with few other questions of

MUCH has of late been said and written which seems to
render desirable a restatement of the causes and conditions
which determine the value of money, the prices of
goods. The remarks referred to are such as intimate or
appear to imply that the extreme extension of credit, to

house, as if these conditions rendered the supply of
money a matter of indifference or at least of very slight
consequence, these allusions on the part of intelligent
business men, and even of professional economists, are so
frequent as to make it seem worth while to go over again

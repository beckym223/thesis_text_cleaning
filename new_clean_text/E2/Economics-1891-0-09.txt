born with a certain adaptation to existing conditions.
Possibly, let us say probably, finding that they are
carrying lightly the burdens which are breaking our
backs, they will set themselves to still further multiply
occasions and social duties and material necessities,
to use up their own strength and time, in turn,
as completely as we have done. But the last is a
question of the future. To-day, having been born
into a world comparatively simple in its organization
and its requirements, we find ourselves in middle life
or old age harrassed, fatigued, and at times despondent,
under the pressure of cares, obligations, engagements

would gladly resign all that I am and have for the
poor privilege of standing, a barefoot pauper, without
a name by which I could be called or a friend in the
world, knocking at the door of an almshouse, where
I might simply lie down and be let alone.
To persons in such a mood, the repose, the relief
from care and painstaking, the release from domestic

which Mr. Bellamy depicts must needs possess a great

to the revenue which they respectively enjoy, although
sometimes treated as a sounding truism, is, at any rate,
unavoidable. So far the economist and the simple poll-
tax payer may very well agree. The former makes his
reservation as to the difficulties, or even impossibility, of
just administration, as Mill did when he "feared that the
fairness which belongs to the principle of an income tax
cannot be made to attach to it in practice, and that this
tax, while apparently the most just of all modes of raising
a revenue, is, in effect, more unjust than many others
which are prima facie more objectionable." To the payer
of the poll tax, however, it appears that the power of
government is equal to every task, and that strict laws.
and severe penalties will readily accomplish the work of
complete and just assessment. Without accepting this
Utopian view of the omnipotence of human law, which is
certainly no more true in the case of taxation than in
any other of the operations of government, we may at
least urge that it is sometimes worth while to inquire how
close an approximation to administrative perfection can
be made. It is the judgment of some important and
enlightened countries, as, for example, of England and
Prussia, that, without attaining absolute success, they
make an approximation near enough to justice to make
it worth their while, under every change of administra-
tion, to maintain a tax upon incomes as a branch of
their regular revenue. The question whether the United
States cannot do the same thing appears to be of some in-
terest. If this government can make such an approxima-
tion, the direct resort to the actual source of all taxation
has much to recommend it in this country.
The most striking defect in the financial system of the
United States is the want of some easy adjustment of the
receipts of the government. As a result of those circum-
stances which have made the customs duties our chief
reliance, the Treasury may sometimes have a plethora

Economic science is an outgrowth of economic conditions.
It is a product of social unrest. From the earliest
discussions of classical antiquity, from the first faint
glimmer of truth in medieval speculation, from the elaboration
of complete systems of thought in the eighteenth
century, down to the recent renaissance of scientific enquiry
in the western hemisphere, each step forward in
economic analysis has been the result of an attempt to
unravel the tangled skein of actual conditions, and of an
effort to solve the difficulties of the existing industrial
society. Consciously or unconsciously the teleological
element has presided at the birth and has accompanied
the growth of all social speculation. "What ought to
be" has ever been the spiritual father of "what is."
It is not intended, of course, to deny the existence of
the independent search for truth for its own sake. On
the contrary, in economics, as in every other scientific
discipline, the highest flights of the intellect have been
in the tenuous and serene atmosphere of pure reason, far
above the turbid waves and windy surface of every day
discussion. It would ill behoove the president of an association
like this to say aught in disparagement of the
fearless and unselfish quest for truth for its own sake.
Amid this onward sweep of material progress and this
tidal wave of mere brutal bigness which threatens to engulf
us all, nothing is more needed than to cling to the

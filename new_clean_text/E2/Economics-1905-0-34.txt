The national and militant feeling, however, has effects
on public opinion far beyond such deliberate weighings
of gain or loss under war and peace. It rouses a whole
train of sentiments which run against trade with other
countries. It fosters international rivalry in every
sphere. Deliberate and accurate weighing of the benefits
of foreign trade, such as it is the business of the
economist to undertake, probably determines the opinions
of a very small circle indeed. The state of mind
of the immense majority is settled by their general feelings
and prepossessions. These are in favor of the
native country and against foreigners; in favor of home
markets and home products, and against foreign competition.
Add to this the strong appeal which protectionist
reasoning makes to the instinctive prejudices and
the inherent selfishness of the every-day man, and you
have an explanation of its continued hold.
In the United States the situation is different from
that in European countries. Here we have in recent
times no industrial invasion from foreigners; we are
ourselves the invaders. The feeling of nationalism is
doubtless strong, and has promoted protection effectively,
but the peculiar fervor which militarism adds to it we
have not experienced, unless it be under the conditions
of the last few years. The maintenance of our protective
system I will not say of any such system, but of the
extreme and intolerant protection which we have developed-
seems to be explicable chiefly on historical
grounds. Certainly its beginning is not to be ascribed
to any deliberate choice. The system as it now stands
goes back to the Civil War, and is the unexpected outcome
of the heavy duties then suddenly imposed. It
has maintained itself chiefly by the effects of custom

product. Does this modification of our assumed condition
require any qualification of our proposition? Probably
we shall all agree that it does not, that the product thus
consumed at home is entirely out of all relation to the
value of money, and that it is only the surplus going into
exchange which has anything to do with determining that
value.
Let us now take the second step from the condition
originally assumed, and recognize the fact that no inconsiderable
part of the surplus product is directly exchanged
without the intervention of money. In the face of the
highly humorous descriptions that have been given of the
difficulties attending such transactions, we know that in
every community, even the most advanced industrially,
barter does take place, and that on no small scale. Let us
suppose the amount of direct exchange within the community
in contemplation to be large. Have the goods
thus exchanged any relation to the value of money? In
one way they have; but it is in the way of effect, and not
of cause. The prices of the several kinds of goods produced
in the community - that is, their value in terms of
moneyâ€”having come to be known through the exchanges
which have taken place with the use of money, the barterers
will be influenced thereby in fixing the ratios of
direct exchange. But this is an incidental effect of the
value of money, not in any sense or any degree a cause.
Were the bartered goods to be multiplied fourfold (but
not at the expense of the goods exchanged for money),
this would have no effect upon prices, since it would alter
neither the demand for nor the supply of money.
It is true that the line drawn in any community between
bartered goods and those sold for money is not a permanent
one. Possibly there has been some failure on the
part of many meritorious economists to recognize the
degree in which barter may be resorted to or may be
abandoned, according as the money in use becomes more

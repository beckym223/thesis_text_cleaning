great corner-stone of our economic order, so diametrically
opposed that what the one cordially hates the
other ardently admires as a source of abundance for all
the deserving children of men? May it not be that,
after all, these disputants are talking about somewhat
different things and that what is needed first of all is
definition?
What precisely do we have in mind when we discuss
competition? Competition, in a large sense, means a
struggle of conflicting interests. If we open our dictionaries
and read the definitions there given, we shall
find something like this in each one of them: "The
act of seeking or endeavoring to gain what another is
endeavoring to gain at the same time; common contest
or striving for the same object; strife for superiority;
rivalry." (Century Dictionary.)
Professor Gide uses these words to tell us what he
understands by competition in this large sense "When
each individual in a country is at liberty to take the
action he considers the most advantageous for himself,
whether as regards the choice of an employment or the
disposal of his goods, we are living under the r√©gime of
competition."
But we do not have enough precision in these definitions
to answer our purposes. Economic competition,
it is true, is a struggle of conflicting interests for valuable
things, for what we call in its widest sense wealth.
But is all struggle for wealth, competition? If I knock
you down with a sand-bag and rob you, is that to be
called competition? If I fit out an armed ship and
prey upon the commerce of the world, is that competition?
If I cheat you by a lie, are the lie and the
fraud part of the competitive process? The reply

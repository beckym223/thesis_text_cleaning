after all, these disputants are talking about somewhat
different things and that what is needed first of all is

What precisely do we have in mind when we discuss

struggle of conflicting interests. If we open our dic-

find something like this in each one of them: "The
act of seeking or endeavoring to gain what another is

rivalry." (Century Dictionary.)

each individual in a country is at liberty to take the
action he considers the most advantageous for himself,
whether as regards the choice of an employment or the

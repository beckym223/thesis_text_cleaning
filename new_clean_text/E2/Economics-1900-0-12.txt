to call representatives of different parts of the people
together for the authoritative presentation of popular
opinion. At the close of the last century, when other
countries adopted institutions modeled on the English
Parliament, it was intended that they should preserve
this same function as debating bodies; and the most
glorious pages in the history of the United States Congress,
are those in which public opinion was formed and
public spirit roused by speeches like those of Webster
and of Clay. Just as in the sphere of commerce, competition
enables members of the different parts of the
business community to get something wider than a class
view point, and compels them to work to a common
end, so in the sphere of politics did representative government
enable and compel members of the different
geographical sections to get something wider than the
local view point, and to see what was the general sentiment
of the nation of which they formed a part.
In the course of the present century our representative
assemblies have ceased to be places for debate.
The extension of the telegraph and the postal service
has given the different parts of the community means of
information more rapid, although in some respects perhaps
less trustworthy, than that which was furnished
by their Congressional representatives in the olden time.
The press has taken the place of the legislature as a
forum for the formation of public sentiment. Parliaments
and congresses have become bodies for the making
of laws rather than for the making of opinions.
That this change has been accompanied by a loss in
salutary influence of legislative bodies is, I think, unquestionable.
No longer do the members strive to impress
their several convictions on the whole body of
which they form a part; they strive rather to form a

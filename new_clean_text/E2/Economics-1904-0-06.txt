individual the pleasure may still be less than the sacrifice,
and to his neighbor the sacrifice may be less than
the pleasure. I may like a cow more than a horse, or I
may be able to raise a particular horse for less than a
particular cow; but that will not enable me to buy
horses in the market for less than cows. The balance or
equilibrium is not between the pain and the pleasure of
the individual, but between the pain and the pleasure of
the group. Individual utility is indeed not equal to individual
cost; but social marginal utility must everywhere
be equivalent to social marginal cost. The idea that there
is an inevitable opposition between the cost theory and
the utility theory of value rests on the failure to discern
its social basis.
Let us look at some of the consequences of this failure.
The classical economists thought that they had hit upon
an important truth in differentiating the theory of international
trade from that of domestic trade. As finally
developed by Cairnes, the theory of international trade
rests on an acute analysis of reciprocal demand and reciprocal
cost in the sense of comparative social sacrifice.
But Cairnes, like Ricardo and Mill before him, did not
see that the same analysis is applicable to all trade, that
is to all value, because in internal, as well as in international,
commerce the controlling considerations are social,
and not individual in character. It must therefore
not surprise us to find that only the other day the gifted
Prime Minister of England issued a noteworthy pronunciamento
on the tariff agitation, in which he employed
as one of the fundamental premises of the argument for
protection, or rather for retaliation, precisely this unreal
distinction between the theory of international and the
theory of internal trade.' When we reflect on the weight

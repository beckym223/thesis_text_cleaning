unequal strength of those who make a contract, for back
of contract lies inequality in strength of those who form
the contract. Contract does not change existing inequalities
and forces, but is simply the medium through which
they find expression. Wealth and poverty, plenty and
hunger, nakedness and warm clothing, ignorance and
learning face each other in contract, and find expression
in and through contract. According to the theory of
Pufendorf, one of the great jurists of his day, slavery is,
historically, an outcome of contract. I do not think,
myself, that this is a correct view of slavery, as a whole,
but it unquestionably explains slavery in many instances.
Even in our own day contracts have been formed which
have been denounced from the bench as virtual slavery.
I have in mind particularly the well known cases which,
in the present year, were brought before Judge W. C.
Bennett in Columbia, S. C. It appears in the statement
of the case by the Judge that negroes entered into
contracts whereby they surrendered nearly, if not quite
all, those rights which we associate with a condition
of freedom. The form of the contract includes the following:

I agree at all times to be subject to the orders and
commands of said
or his agents, perform all
or his agents shall have
work required of me.
the right to use such force as he or his agents may deem
necessary to compel me to remain on his farm and to perform
good and satisfactory services. He shall have the
right to lock me up for safekeeping, work me under the
rules and regulations of his farm, and if I should leave his
farm or run away he shall have the right to offer and
pay a reward of not exceeding $25 for my capture and
return, together with the expenses of same, which
amount so advanced, together with any other indebtedness

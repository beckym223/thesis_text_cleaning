Present Position of the Doctrine of Free Trade 61
even stronger; and every European nation habitually
holds itself in readiness for war.
Even the sober economist, unmoved by sentiment,
and looking solely to the direct and traceable conse-
quences of this state of things, must admit that here is
a situation that does not fit into the free trade ideal.
Great Britain, for example, depends for feeding her
people on foreign supplies; and it is an inevitable con-
sequence, however regrettable a one, that she must have
a powerful navy as security against starvation in case
of war.
No doubt the balance of material gain is in
her case clearly in favor of free trade: it is cheaper to
have a navy, even a huge and expensive one, than it
would be to support her population at home. But, as
international relations now stand, there exists this ex-
pense to be offset against the gain. In Germany at the
present time the same set of persons who advocate the
development of Germany as an exporting country and
a "world-power" demand a great navy. Oddly enough.
these same persons are protectionists also. But if a
navy is needful to safeguard exports, it is no less needful
for the imports which must also come.
It is but another phase of the same drawback against
the gain from international trade, that it is liable to
interruption. A war between the great countries, such
as is always possible and often seems imminent, would
greatly hamper foreign trade, conceivably destroy it.
The greater the previous extension of trade, the more
complete the overturn of commerce; and he who looks
on war as sooner or later inevitable, and perhaps as not
unwelcome, is not loth to have the industries of his
country as self-contained and as self-dependent as
possible.

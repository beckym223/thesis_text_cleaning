opinion to bolster up this demand for the retention and
strengthening of the right kind of competition. In
antiquity political and social opinion was a class
opinion. In the middle ages the incoherent public
opinion was intolerant to competition. In modern
times the progress of economic thought and the press-
ure of economic fact in uplifting the hitherto sub-
merged classes of the community are generating a pub-
lic opinion which frankly recognizes the benefits of a
healthy competition, but which insists more and more
on effective social control of competition to the end that
it be elevated and purified.
This is the true meaning of the sixth point of differ-
ence, the flower and the fruit of all its forerunners,â€”the
existence of the democratic ideal. We point, indeed, with
complacency to the advance made by the working classes,
but to those who realize the essential conditions of suc-
cessful democracy, where the mass of citizens are neces-
sarily the laborers, the ideal to be attained advances still
more quickly than the actual progress. The brutish,
lethargic peasant of the old world is content with his
crust and his misery. The free citizen of our industrial
democracy wants, and wants justly, to participate in the
spiritual as well as the material benefits of modern civili-
zation. With every advance in his economic position,
due to the interplay of modern industrial forces, new
vistas of possibilities disclose themselves, new sources
of legitimate satisfaction make their appearance. The
social unrest of to-day, with all its disquieting and de-
plorable incidents, is on the whole a salutary symptom.
It is but the labor-pains in the birth of the new industrial
order which has been in the making for the past few
generations, and of which the faint outlines are even now
discernible.

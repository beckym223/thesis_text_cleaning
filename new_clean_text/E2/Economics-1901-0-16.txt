inasmuch as in his view it is opposed to the interests of
the great mass of men who, he thinks, quietly submit
to this social order, on account of the social force in religion
which bids them do so. Religion has quite a
different office to perform, for its office is rather to raise
competition to higher planes and to mingle with it in a
harmonious blend, sympathy and love, without by any
means displacing competition itself.
Competition gives us a brave, strong race of men,
and the brave and strong are merciful.
It has been well said that as organic evolution gives.
us man, so social evolution gives the ideal man.' But
economic competition is an essential constituent of that
social evolution which is producing the ideal man; and
with competition are mingled other regulative principles.
Psychologically, the ego and the alter ego, self and
other self, arise together; economically they engage in
many a conflict, but their spheres of interest are never
entirely antagonistic to each other in the struggle for
life. The ego-the self-enlarges the sphere of its selfhood;
and this widening and deepening goes on until
the Christian ideal of humanity is at last attained.
But the upward struggle is part and parcel of the
attainment of ideals; and, rightly conceived, elevated
to a sufficient height, this struggle in economic life
means competition; it means rivalry in the service of
self and other selves-rivalry in the upbuilding of the
ideal man in the ideal society.

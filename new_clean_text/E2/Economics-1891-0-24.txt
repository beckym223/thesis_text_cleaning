nation is in peril from this cause, time will have
been gained for discovering and applying a remedy
before it shall be too late. If, on the other hand, we
shall be convinced that the republic can, in spite of
all, safely continue to keep its ports open to all
comers, without challenge and without discrimina-
tion, patiently enduring some present evil rather
than surrender its proud name as the asylum for the
oppressed of every race and every clime, our action
will then have a double virtue, inasmuch as it will be,
not by accident, or inadvertence, or sheer incapacity
for studying the future, but intelligently, solemnly,
and of set purpose, that we take up the burden of
the woes and wrongs of our fellow-men which the
waves and tides of Ocean thus bring to our feet.

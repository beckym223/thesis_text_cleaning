Iron is
When we say, correctly enough, that value' is the ex-
pression of utility, we really mean that it is the expres-
sion of social marginal utility. While social utility in-
deed is made up of a combination of individual utilities
â€”that is, while a thing cannot be useful to society un-
less it is useful to the individuals who compose the social
group, the marginal utility that controls value is the re-
flection of the social marginal utility. Even though a
pound of iron may at a given moment conceivably be
of more direct use to an individual than a pound of dia-
monds, a pound of iron does not satisfy as many, or as
urgent, social wants as a pound of diamonds.
less valuable than diamonds because its social marginal
utility is less. In the same way, when we say that value
depends on cost, we refer really to social, not to individ-
ual, cost. The street sweeper may work harder than an
opera singer, yet the value of his services will be less.
It may cost me five days to make a table that the fac-
tory will turn out in five hours, yet my table will not
sell for more. The marginal cost around which values.
gravitate is not individual cost, but social cost. The
value of a commodity is due not to the labor of the in-
dividual who has made it, but to the social service which
it is going to render, that is, to the social sacrifice which
it is going to save. When we say that individual cost
of production fixes value, we really mean that it ex-
presses the value that is fixed by social forces as a whole.
The failure to recognize the essential equivalence of
marginal utility and marginal cost is due to the neglect
of this social element. It is true indeed that in modern
life there is no such equivalence for the individual con-
sidered as such; and this has led most thinkers astray.

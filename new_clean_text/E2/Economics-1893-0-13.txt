croached upon than it is, this would not impair the validity
of our proposition. As I said in the earlier part of this
paper, the use of credit simply means the diminution of
the demand for money. It still remains true that the demand
for money, whatever that may be, does, taken in connection
with supply, determine prices. No civilized country
has ever reached the condition, and we are not called
upon to contemplate a time within which any civilized
country will reach a condition, in which money must not
be used to a vast extent. So long as people must have it,
to pay wages and to buy goods, they must buy it, they must
pay its price for it, they must give what it is worth.
What it shall be worth will depend upon the demand for
and the supply of it, as in case of any other thing that is
bought and sold. The demand for money is found in the
money work to be done, the amount of exchanging which
needs to be effected by the use of money. The supply of
money consists in the number of money-pieces available
for the work of exchange, taken in connection with the
facility with which they can be so used, the freedom or
rapidity of circulation. Outside this field, it does not for
this purpose matter in the least what the volume of credit
may be, how high may be piled the transactions of banks
and clearing houses. Were we considering the security of
the latter, it would be important to compare their volume
with the amount of money circulating within the field of
cash payments; but this is not our business to-day.
When the present paper was placed upon the programme
of the Association, I little thought that in defending
my thesis I should enjoy the advantage of such a tremendous,
such an overwhelming demonstration of the importance
of the actual money of a country, in the face of the
most elaborate organization of credit, as the United States
has afforded during the past two months. Sir John Lubbock'

the old basis. First a large part of their population is
transferred from agricultural to manufacturing indus-
tries, and then must be transferred back to agriculture
again. Each process of transition is necessarily slow
and possibly painful, and the suffering and losses out-
weigh the temporary benefit during the comparatively
brief period of cheaper food supply. Is it not wiser to
protect agriculture for awhile, and keep industry in its
even and permanent course?
Here again the answer turns on the temporary nature
of the situation. If it were clear that the cheaper food
supplies would cease to be available after ten years, or
twenty years, there would seem to be good grounds for
resisting this American invasion. The longer the pe-
riod over which the new conditions are likely to last,
and the more uncertain their end or the stages by which
their end will be reached, the weaker is the case for re-
sistance. Now, all the indications are that the relations
between new countries and old countries, as they have
developed during the last half-century, will endure for
Ã  long period, a period not to be measured by years or
decades, perhaps not by generations. Many have been
the books and pamphlets published during the last
twenty years, foretelling that the end was near, and
that the opening of new sources of supply had ceased.
Yet the building of new railways and the general ad-
vance in transportation, as well as the discovery of re-
gions not before thought available, have accentuated the
present situation of the modern world, and have post-
poned to an indefinite future the predicted reaction. To
attempt now to make provision for such an indefinite
future is at the least very doubtful policy. What will
be the relation, a century hence, between the old coun-
tries and the countries now new; what will then be the

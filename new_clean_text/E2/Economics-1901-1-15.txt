which may well be compared with that which the study
of mathematics or other abstruse subjects may give.
This has been my idea from the beginning, and I am
gratified to find it substantiated and developed theoreti-
cally and practically in so many of the strictly univer-
sity departments which have been organized for this
purpose either in Europe or in the United States.
Political economy, theoretic or applied, includes, of

ing, insurance, etc., etc., at least in their general aspects.

subjects alone. I believe that all those subjects neces-

such curriculum, commercial geography, commercial law
and similar subjects.

times called with a sneering connotation "bookkeep-

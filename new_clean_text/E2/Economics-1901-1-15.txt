which may well be compared with that which the study
of mathematics or other abstruse subjects may give.
This has been my idea from the beginning, and I am
gratified to find it substantiated and developed theoretically
and practically in so many of the strictly university
departments which have been organized for this
purpose either in Europe or in the United States.
Political economy, theoretic or applied, includes, of
course, a wide range of subjects, such as finance, banking,
insurance, etc., etc., at least in their general aspects.
But I am not content with the introduction of these
subjects alone. I believe that all those subjects necessary

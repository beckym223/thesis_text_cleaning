What is the real import of
First, the virtual disappearance of free land. This
makes slavery forever impossible in the future. Recent
investigations have proved beyond the peradventure of
a doubt that slavery as a typical economic system is
ascribable to the existence of vast quantities of untilled
tracts suitable for agriculture. Where any one can procure
fresh land for nothing, he will not readily work for
another; and when the soil is so exuberantly fertile
that it can endure the wastefulness of slave cultivation,
compulsory and not voluntary labor will be the dominant
characteristic of the production. Slavery did not become
important in Greece until the colonies yielded vast
stretches of virgin land; the yeoman farmer in Rome
did not disappear until the world conquests of the later
republic threw into the market such prodigious supplies
of new territory as to make slave labor on the large
estates lucrative. It was precisely the same cause that
produced slavery in the West Indies and on the American
continent. Those days, however, have gone, never to
return. Fresh supplies of that kind of land are with
insignificant exceptions no longer procurable.
older countries are quite filled up, and in the newer
sections conditions are unfavorable. In both Australia
and Siberia the climate is inimical to slavery. In South
America the pampas are the home of a grazing rather
than of an agricultural commnnity, and it is well known.
that the flock tending and herding life is not conducive
to slavery on a large scale; on the other hand, the agricultural
regions of South America have realized that
slave production is inadequate to meet the competition
of free labor in the world market where their products
are sold. It is only in the mining districts of South

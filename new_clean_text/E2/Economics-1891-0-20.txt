that which would be an adequate compensation
for injury done to the character and the future of
this free, peaceful commonwealth of educated labor.
The moment the access of foreigners begins, by reason
either of their numbers or of their condition, to
lower the standard of living here and to impair the
self-respect and social ambition of our people, that
moment we may say that thereafter we can do more
for Europeans in Europe than we could do for them
upon our own soil.
No one has ever put into words the half or the
tithe of the industrial blessings which the New World
has already conferred upon the Old, through the example
it has given of intelligence, mobility and
successful enterprise among the people, through the
standard of general comfort and decency which it
has maintained, and through the strong, steady
pressure its competition has exerted upon the employers
of underfed and overworked labor. I sincerely
believe that the influence of this land beyond the
seas has been the greatest single force which has
worked during the past fifty years for the elevation
of the masses over there. And never did Europe
need America
America
America at its best%; successful,
prosperous America - so much as now. Never
before did it so clearly appear that the New World
had been called into existence to redress the disturbed
balance of the Old. I say, therefore, that,
whether we look at this question as patriots or as
philanthropists, our first duty is to see to it that
this political and industrial experiment does not fail;
our second duty is to make it as glorious and conspicuous
a success as possible.

in slaves was at one time considered economically advantageous
and morally defensible. Private ownership of
the highways was not so long ago usual and justifiable.
In the city of New York to-day the process of the extinction
of private property in docks is fast going on.
If, as Carlyle tells us, no one believes what his grandfather
believed, we may almost say no man owns what
his grandfather has owned. Moreover, not only do we
no longer own the same things, but even where this is
the case, we do not own them in precisely the same
way. What phrases are more common to-day than the
obligation of wealth—the public trusteeship of property,
and the like. How long will it be before we tread the
same path that has been opened up in the fiscal domain,
where voluntary contributions have become transmuted
into compulsory payments, and where the moral duty
is now converted into a legal obligation. With the advance
of society the individual element in the justification
and in the content of private property recedes, and
the social element comes to the fore.
Another application of the same principle may be
seen in the controversy that is agitating all parts of our
country to-day-the labor question, with the problem of
trade-unionism and the open shop. If there were time,
it would be profitable to dwell upon this thought—that
while there is indeed only too much truth in the contention
that many of our unions are steering perilously close
to the rocks of monopoly and extortion, the problem
cannot be solved simply by emphasizing the right of the
individual laborer. The right of the individual to work
is indeed, as Turgot told us over a century ago, a sacred
and imprescriptible right; but the conditions under which
this right is to be exercised are by no means a matter of
mere individual discretion and of social unconcern. We

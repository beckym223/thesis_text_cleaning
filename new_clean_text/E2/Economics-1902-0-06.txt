in the fact that we have discovered human nature
to be a more complex thing than it was thought to be
in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Instead
of a very simple psychology, we have a very complex
psychology underlying our twentieth century thought.
Inequalities among men we now know are natural, or
the natural outcome of the kind of a world in which
we live, inhabited by our kind of beings. Men are
what they are as a result of heredity, as well as en-
vironment. Moreover, we have a heredity of environ-

The outcome of this is found in the fact now clearly
perceived by those who think deeply on such subjects,
that in contract men who are, in one way and another
unequals, face each other and that their inequality ex-
presses itself in the contracts which determine their
economic condition.
Another cause of the change in view concerning the
achievement of liberty, is found in the growing com-
plexity of society, especially on its economic side. Men
are brought into society in a real and vital sense by the
relations existing among them, and these relations have
multiplied enormously during the past century. The
economic ties uniting men in society were relatively
few and simple in 1776. Their growth, extensively and
intensively, is a matter of familiar knowledge at the
present time.
It is a mere truism to say that our well-
being in industrial matters depends on others, as well as
on ourselves. Our economic well-being is an outcome.
of satisfactory relations existing between the individual
and society. Now these relations which bind man to
his fellow-men are to only a limited extent of a political
nature. Consequently it follows that restrictions upon
liberty are, for the most part, outside of and beyond

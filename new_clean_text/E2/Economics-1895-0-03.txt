President's Address.

from a natural policy now appears. Compulsory arbitra-
tion would adjust wages in a way that would depart
more or less from the standard set by the productivity
of labor. Voluntary arbitration has to conform to that
standard. Fixing by law the prices of goods produced
by trusts would introduce an arbitrary element into dis-
tribution. Keeping the field open for new competitors,
and in this natural way holding the exactions of trusts
in check, would make distribution normal.
A policy is open to us that, at every step, liberates
natural economic forces, and tends to make the system
of industry honest, productive and even democratic. It
increases the productive power, and, therefore, the pay
of laborers. We take no apologetic tone in defending
this system. Evil comes through the perversion of it,
and good is inherent in it. Whether we shall retain
this system or not is not an open question. We shall
have to retain it. Society feels its way by experiments;
and while a few measures that look socialistic may be re-
tained, those that, by the test here used, are really
socialistic are sure to be abandoned. In the end legal
forces must co√∂perate with natural economic forces.
They will make competition normal and free. For the
sake of men now living let this harmonious action be-
gin at once.

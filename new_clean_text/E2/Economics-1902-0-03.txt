understand the theoretical and practical conclusions
reached by that philosophy. The problem which presented
itself to our forefathers, and to French statesmen,
as well as to English thinkers, was essentially negative.
Restrictions must be removed. Favoritism must be
abolished, and the laws making possible restrictions and
favoritism must be repealed. The restrictions upon
liberty which were then noticed were restrictions of a
political nature. Consequently the problem of liberty
was conceived to be essentially a political problem, as
well as a negative one.
Closely associated with this doctrine of equality was
the doctrine of the beneficence of self-interest. Inasmuch
as men were essentially equal, each one could best
guard his own interests individually, provided only the
hampering fetters of the law should make way for a
reign of liberty. Time does not permit me to follow
out, as I would like, the development of this negative
view of liberty, which I have presented. From it we
may trace out a very clearly marked line of evolution of
thought, and a somewhat less clearly marked line of
evolution of political practice. Through various
writers we reach Herbert Spencer's treatment of liberty
as a negative and political problem. The great enemy
of freedom, he holds, is the state manifesting itself in
laws directing human activity, and in his opinion, leading
inevitably to slavery, unless the flow of legislation
is in some way checked. We find Herbert Spencer
preaching his doctrine of liberty in his "Social Statics"
in 1851, and asserting in it the right of man to disregard
the state, and in more recent times he expounds his
doctrine in articles bearing such titles as these: "The
Coming Slavery", "The Sins of Legislators", "The
Great Political Superstition."

arily think of the individual-of the burden upon one
man as compared with that upon his neighbor. For in
last resort it is always the individual who pays, either
by dipping his hand into his own pocket, or by suffering
a diminution in the revenue which he would enjoy if
there were no tax. On this assumption we proceed to
elaborate our highly wrought theories of fiscal equity.
Thus we say that taxes should be proportional or progressive,
that equality means relative equality as between
individuals in the community, and that the real sacrifice
imposed upon one man should not differ from that imposed
upon his neighbor.
It is indeed true that writers on finance have been
cognizant of the fact that not all taxes are borne by
those that pay them in first instance. A chapter or two
on the shifting and incidence of taxation is to be found
in almost every treatise. But for the most part the distinction
has been between direct and indirect taxes; and
in the case of the indirect taxes, which are shifted to
the final consumer, it has usually been thought that
there is no room for any application of the doctrine of
ability and sacrifice. To this is to be ascribed, in part
at least, the effort of modern fiscal reformers to diminish
the scope of indirect taxes.

which is subsequently disposed of by purchase
and sale we must regard the economic law governing
the transaction and study the consequences which affect
other individuals, i.e., the social results. If, however,
the owner of the article does not dispose of it directly,
but uses it to secure a revenue with which he then
parts, we call it by some hocus pocus a tax on property,
not a tax on commodities; and we shut our eyes to the

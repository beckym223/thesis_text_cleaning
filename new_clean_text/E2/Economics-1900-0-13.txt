compromise in which the interests of the part which
they represent shall have adequate recognition. This
substitution of compromise for conviction as the ideal
of legislative activity is perhaps the greatest and most
pervasive evil under which our political machinery
suffers. It shows its effect in the demoralizing principle
that the representative should be guided in his
utterances and his votes by the opinions of his constituents,
rather than by his own—a principle which, in
spite of all protests, has come to be generally accepted
in practical politics. It deprives the member of the
legislature of the educational influence incident to his
position. It makes him an agent not only of his district,
but of his party within his district. It manifests
its results in appropriation bills, where the members
who stand up for the general interest of the treasury are
increasingly rare, and those who make claims for the
expenditure of money on behalf of their localities-and
often on behalf of private interests within their localities—
become constantly louder. It shows itself even in
general legislation, where the character of modern
statutes as a patchwork of private demands has become
only too notorious.
All this has gone so far as to produce a change in the
public estimate of parliamentary bodies. The glorification
or idealization of the legislature, so common in
generations immediately gone by, is rapidly passing
away.
In matters of municipal government we are lessening
the application of the old representative system—
giving more power to the mayor and those persons appointed
by the mayor, and less to the representatives of
the several districts; because, with the amount of business
that is done by the ordinary municipality, we cannot
afford to let the general interests of the whole be

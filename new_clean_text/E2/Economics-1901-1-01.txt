RELATION OF THE COLLEGE AND UNIVER-
SITY TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL
EDUCATION.
BY EDMUND J. JAMES.
The movement in this country for college and uni-
versity training for the future business man seems to
have entered within the last year or two upon a new era
in its history. Twenty years ago, when I first began to
insist that our business classes stood in need of higher
special or professional education, and that this educa-
tion should be given in our colleges and universities,
my voice was like that of one crying in the wilderness
unheeded either by the business world, on the one hand,
or by the college world on the other.'
Even up to within ten years only one institution of
high rank had been found willing to move in this direc-
tion and to accord a half-hearted and timid support to the
idea. To-day, at least a dozen of our leading institutions,
and in this list one-half dozen of the most prominent in-
stitutions, have decided to organize departments whose
primary function is that of furnishing a higher training
for commercial life.
The University of Pennsylvania lead the way nearly
twenty years ago by the establishment of the Wharton
School of Finance and Economy in 1881, though the
real work was not begun until 1883.2
The University of Chicago, although its original an-
nouncement in 1892 included the scheme of a College of
of Practical Affairs, did not carry out the plan until July 1,

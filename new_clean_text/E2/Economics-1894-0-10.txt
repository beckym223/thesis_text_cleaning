general property taxes, which have been so familiar a part
of our local taxation throughout this century, and in some
States for a still longer period? We have had painful
evidence of the truth of Leroy-Beaulieu's extremely cautious
observation that “nulle société humaine n'est compos
ée en totalité d'hommes d'une inflexible probité." In
an earlier generation and in a simpler community, where
every man's affairs were tolerably well known to his
neighbors, and probably differed little in kind from those
of his neighbors, and when the opportunities for investment
were comparatively few, and chiefly of such kinds as
to be well open to observation, the process of self-assessment
by declaration in some form to assessing officers may
have answered its purpose; although, even in this case,
the chief safeguard was probably the notoriety of essential
facts rather than the individual sense of duty among our
predecessors, strong as that may have been. But with
the growth of wealth and the change in social conditions
there has been substituted for this primitive state of
things, over a large part of our country, an organization
of astonishing complexity, in which the affairs of the
individual are known to others little beyond the point
which he may choose; and his opportunities for the unobserved
investment of capital may almost be said to be infinite.
State legislation has often attempted to support
the flagging conscience of tax-payers by increased stringency,
until in some cases the laws prescribing the form of
declaration, and seeking to probe to its depths the knowledge
of the declarant, are miracles of ingenuity. And yet
there is probably no State in which the attempt to tax
personal property, upon a list made out by the tax-payer
under the requirements of the law, any longer succeeds.
In the emphatic words of a board of commissioners in a
State which has been said to bear the palm for the minuteness
and scope of its inquisition, so far as the statute is
concerned, "fully one-half of the property of a modern

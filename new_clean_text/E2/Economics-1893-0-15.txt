not want of capital, for the nation had never been so rich;
not the lack of credit in commercial relations, for the his-

bankers to trust each other and to support each other,
even at the risk of their own fortunes. The trouble was

money supply, due to distrust of financial legislation.
This was all, and this was enough to bring the United
States nearer to general ruin than it has been before since
the war made us a nation indeed.

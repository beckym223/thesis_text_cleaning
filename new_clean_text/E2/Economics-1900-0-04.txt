On the other hand, a man's theory of prosperity is
closely interwoven with his theories of ethics and of
politics. Moral and political standards are a determin-
ing element in our judgment as to whether a nation's
aggregate condition is good or bad. Observation as to
the effect of different industrial systems on the stability
or destruction of a nation reacts, in turn, upon our
moral and political judgments. It is at this point that
the interaction between economics and politics, whether
by way of mutual aid or mutual criticism, is most con-
Only occasionally and incidentally do our
theories of distribution lead us to intervene in political
affairs by showing that certain lines of legislation pro-
duce different results from those which are contemplated.
Daily and hourly does our theory of prosperity lead us
to such intervention, when we believe that the aims of
a certain group of moralists or politicians are destructive
to the well-being of the nation as a whole.

At this point, where the possibility of influence is
greatest, the difficulty which meets the economist who
strives to maintain a dispassionate and critical attitude is

logical selection; and can guard himself against error
in fact or deduction by the same methods which are
used by the physicist or the biologist for the same pur-
pose.
But when he comes to measure the aggregate
merit of the total result, he has a different task and a

I said a year ago, and I still believe, that even in this
task the scientific knowledge possessed by the economist
enables him to come nearer to its fulfillment than can

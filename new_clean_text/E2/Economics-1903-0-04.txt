widely recognized, many implications of the older theory
still survive, and continue to exert a baneful and constricting
influence.
Take, for instance, the opinion either explicitly or
implicitly shared by many of our thoughtful fellow
citizens that this country has in some way a distinctive
mission to perform, and that we are marked off from
the rest of the world by certain inherent principles,
relative indeed, in the sense of being peculiar to
America, but eternal and immutable in their relation to
ourselves. Now I certainly do not desire to depreciate
the advantages of patriotism, or to impeach the unquestioned.

factor of all social progress. The friction of commercial
and intellectual intercourse, notwithstanding the
sanguinary struggles by which it has often been attended,
has proved to be the most potent influence in
generating and spreading the light of civilization. To
disparage the facts and the force of nationality were
futile indeed. And as with nationality, so with patriotism.
Nations, like individuals, must respect themselves.

ardent faith in their own strength and their own
powers of progress. To minimize the value of patriotism
and its abiding beneficence would be shortsighted
in the extreme.
But how often are the claims of nationality pushed to
an extravagant and unwarrantable length! We have
indeed learned to put in their proper setting the contentions

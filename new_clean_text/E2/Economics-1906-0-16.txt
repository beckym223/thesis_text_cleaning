Checks and balances are part of the wonted political
machinery. A permanent executive with a free hand
is repugnant alike to the individual's instinct for control
over his representative, and to his prepossessions as to
the proper system of government. The two causes
interact, and reinforce each other; and both tend to
keep out of the public service the type of man whom
the public most needs.
Contrast for a moment the ultra-democratic situation,
inhibiting as it does continuous leadership and achievement,
with its most extreme opposite. There are no more
interesting episodes in history, and in some respects none
more encouraging, than the careers of the British
colonial administrators. The peculiar conditions have
bred a peculiar set of men. Here are power, responsibility,
prolonged tenure, difficult problems; on the other
hand, plastic subject races, habituated for ages to autocratic
government. The work of such men as Lord
Lawrence, in the Punjab, or in our day Lord Cromer in
Egypt, deservedly wins our admiration. Here the impulse
for mastery has had full scope, and has been
directed to beneficent channels. The ambition of every
active-spirited civil servant is fired by the possibilities of
great achievement, when once he shall have reached the
post of leadership. Even in the lower stages he is from
the outset habituated to a position of command. The
admirable traditions which have been fostered during the
past century by the curiously mixed government of Great
Britain, half a democracy, half an oligarchy of gentlemen,
â€”served to turn this autocratic power to the
achievements of peace. Hence the unique interest of
the careers of the great colonial administrators. Their
dictatorship gives them the dramatic position of worldconquerors,
yet their labors are directed to the singleminded
promotion of the happiness and prosperity of the
subject millions.
Instructive in a somewhat similar way is the experience
of Germany, and especially of Prussia. Notwithstanding

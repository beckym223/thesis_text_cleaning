socially established ends to be attained by competition
determine the kind of men who will survive in com-
petition. Let me offer an illustration. To-day the
civil service of the modern nation furnishes an oppor-
tunity for a livelihood to a considerable percentage of
the population. Competition for admission to the civil
service in order thereby to secure a support is found
when we have the so-called spoils system, and the com-
petition is intense and frequently bitter. This competi-
tive contest issues in the survival of men with qualities
known to us all. Civil service reform does not remove
competition; on the contrary it extends competition,
but the difference in methods produces corresponding
differences in results. On the one hand, the extension
of competition lessens bitterness, because it is more in
in consonance with our ethical demand for equality of
opportunity, and the difference in competitive tests for
success, issues in the survival of men with qualities of
another sort from those which come to the top under
the spoils system, and with qualities, most of us will
say, of a higher kind.
Competition increasingly comes to mean worthy
struggle, and true progress implies that success will be
secured hereafter by conformity to higher and ever
higher, nobler and ever nobler ideas.
Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace and Professor Lester F.
Ward have called attention to the superiority of man's
selection to nature's selection. Professor Ward has
thus expressed the idea: "The economics of nature
consists, therefore, essentially in the operation of the
law of competition in its purest form. The prevailing
idea, however, that it is the fittest possible that survive
in this struggle is wholly false. The effect of competi-
tion is to prevent any form from attaining its maximum
development, and to maintain a comparatively low

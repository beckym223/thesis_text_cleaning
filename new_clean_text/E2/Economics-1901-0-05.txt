comes naturally, "No, you are now talking about
criminal and wrong action."
But if it is not every struggle of conflicting interests
that is to be denominated competition, we see at once
that competition is a struggle which has its metes and
bounds. I think we must say that the competitive
struggle is limited by constitutional and statute law.
It is a struggle whose boundaries are fixed by the social
order within the framework of which we live and move
and exercise our faculties in the pursuit of a livelihood.
When we bear this qualification in mind, simple and
obvious as it is, many difficulties begin to vanish like
fog before the rising sun. Many a man, when competi-

rending each other in a death struggle for an insufficient
supply of food. But such is only an incomplete and

the brutes, and does not at all describe the struggle of
competition among civilized men.
But even when we call to mind the limitations
placed upon the struggle of conflicting economic inter-
ests by the social order, we do not yet have a sufficient
idea of economic competition. It is essential that we
add another element to our idea, in order to render it
more nearly conformable to reality. We must bring to
mind the great principle of evolution which is present
wherever there is life. Nothing could well be more
unscientific in the present age of science than to leave
evolution out of account in our examination of anything
so fundamental in society as competition. What light,

competition?
The struggle for existence among the lower animals
has become a commonplace of modern scientific thought,

theory is to be sought not in the fact that it propounded
a hedonistic explanation of morality, but in that it placed
itself upon the narrow ground of individual utility.
rather than upon the broad foundation of social utility.
Our concern, however, is with economic, rather than
with ethical, forces; and in the economic field we
have ample and palpable proof of the short comings of
the individual point of view, in history and in theory
alike.
Take, for instance, Adam Smith's account of the es-
sential principle of economic progress. You remember
that Adam Smith finds the explanation in the division
of labor, and thinks that this is the result of a certain
trait in human nature, "the propensity to truck, barter,
and exchange one thing for another." This individual
propensity is made by Adam Smith the corner stone of
his entire edifice of economics. Yet modern research in
ethnology has disclosed the undoubted fact that he is
quite mistaken. Far from there having been a natural
propensity in man to truck and barter, the original pro-
pensity was just the reverse. Exchange was at the outset,
and for many long centuries, considered not natural, but
unnatural; not normal, but abnormal; not economic,
but uneconomic; not useful, but reprehensible.
An analysis of the very terms used by Adain Smith
shows this clearly enough. To truck is etymologically
to trick, to cheat; barter is another form of barrator,
and although barratry persists to-day only as a particu-
lar kind of crime, its primary meaning was far broader.
Exchange was therefore originally deemed a bad thing,
a heinous offence, as involving a wrong to the other
party.
But, furthermore, we now know with some degree of
verisimilitude how barter arose, and how it slowly

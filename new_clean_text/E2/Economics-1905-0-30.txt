are touched. In the theory of value, of distribution, of
prices and the value of money, as well as in that of
international trade, there is in many current manuals
and text-books a pseudo-judicial attitude, which admits
some merit in this position as well as in its opposite,
opines that such a view must indeed be considered but
must not be pressed too far, and such further double-
facing expressions, which end in leaving the reader
quite in the dark as to the author's conclusions as to
the heart of the matter in hand.
It is easy to account for this stage of thought, especi-
ally among the writers of the second rank. In many
directions economic theory is being re-fashioned, and on
many topics there is not yet a consensus of opinion. At
least, there does not appear to be such a consensus;
though the differences among economic thinkers on the
large questions of principle are much less fundamental
than they are sometimes made to appear. Yet it is not
to be denied that on some deep-reaching topics, especi-
ally in the theory of distribution, economic theory is
now in a stage of transition. As it happens, however,
there has been least attempt at change, and there is
least occasion for change, in the theory of international
trade. On that part of the subject, the edifice of which
the foundation was laid by Adam Smith and his con-
temporaries, and which was further built up by Ricardo,
Senior, and the younger Mill, remains substantially as it
was put together by these ancient worthies. Something
has indeed been added by recent writers; yet nothing
that calls for a remodelling of the old structure. On
the nature of international trade, on its peculiarities, its
working machinery in the foreign exchanges and the
flow of specie, its connection with the drift of labor and
capital to different industries, its bearing on the demand

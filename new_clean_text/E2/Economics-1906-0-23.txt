masters or learned scholars, do not suffice for shaping
human character.
The American people has undergone great changes in
the last fifty years. No one can undertake to say what
will be the outcome, after another fifty years, of the
revolution in industry through which we are passing,
and of our extraordinary mingling of nationalities. Yet
I believe that the heart of the people is sound, and that
democracy will emerge successfully from the difficulties
of adjustment to the new conditions. Not without effort,
not without trials, not without disappointments; least of
all, by any rapid or revolutionary changes; yet in the end
with success. Our political machinery is improving, and
is likely still further to improve. The worship of wealth
is diminishing, and the respect for public service is increasing.
Men of character and capacity will win in
the long run the suffrage of the people, and corruption
and jobbery will be rebuked. The fundamental virtues
are not lacking, and we may base upon them our devices
for enlisting high-minded ability, for raising general
intelligence, for bettering the working details of
government. We may expect that the sphere of public
enterprises will be enlarged, as the lessons necessary.
for the successful conduct of such enterprises are
learned. We may hope for greater repression of the
selfish motives and the sordid activities, for freer play to
noble ambition and public spirited effort, and not only for
a stronger government but for a better and purer democracy.

classifying inherited property as income. It is obvious
that, in this capital point of the definition of income, the
present tax gives up the idea of preserving any tenable
line. The treatment of this precise point by the Prussian
income-tax law of 1891 is instructive. After defining tax-
able income as the annual receipts from invested capital,
from real estate, from trade and industry, and from other.

abundant caution, to draw a line between the income and

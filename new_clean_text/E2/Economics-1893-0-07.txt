transaction of the same amount in direct exchange or
barter. The fact that each obligation has been expressed
in terms of money, the fact that, in the buying and the
selling which preceded the giving of the note of hand or
bill of exchange, reference was had by both parties to
prices determined by actual exchanges of goods for money,
―these facts do not, it seems to me, at all impair the validity
of the view that, so far as the use and the value of
money are concerned, such transactions are, in essence,
cases of barter.
But it may be said such transactions do, in fact, involve
the use of money.
The bankers' liabilities, which are
made up of deposits of commercial paper coming due, and
which constitute the fund upon which those who are
debtors to others, but are creditors to the bank, may draw
checks for the payment of their own obligations, — these
banker's liabilities, or bank deposits, are, many persons assert,
themselves money. I am well aware that this view
has been held by those of whom it is needful to speak
with very great respect. Such was the opinion of Lord
Overstone; and Professor Sidgwick has more recently
presented the same view. But I must say that it seems
more compatible with the facts of commercial life, as well
as far more conducive to a consistent and intelligent
philosophy of money, to treat this matter of the cancellation
of indebtedness in the way which has been suggested
above. Bank-notes are money. They are distinct
and tangible things, which pass out from the bank and
have their own separate life and course; which become
the property of him in whose hands they at the time are, as
truly as do coins of gold or silver. Like such coins, they
pass from hand to hand throughout the community, without
reference to the character or the credit of the person
offering them. Like such coins, they are accepted in final
discharge of debts and full payment for commodities,
without necessary recourse to the issuing bank, except as

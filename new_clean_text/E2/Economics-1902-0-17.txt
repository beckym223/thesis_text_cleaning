standpoint of liberty, there can be no doubt whatever
about this principle. Yet it is easy for contract to abro-
gate the right of contract. Whenever a man contracts
himself into a condition of virtual slavery, this is the
case. I have already cited the well-known cases brought.
before Judge Bennett of South Carolina. Cases have
arisen in Germany, under what is called the "competi-
tive clause" of labor contracts. It seems that there it is
quite customary to insist upon a contract with an em-
ployee, learning a trade or occupation, that he shall not,
after he has acquired his knowledge of the business,
enter into competition with his employer. Sometimes
there is a limitation upon the period or area within
which no competition must be attempted, making the
clause a fairly reasonable one. Sometimes, however, a
lad utterly incompetent to contemplate the remote con-
sequences of his act, and not having five dollars to his
name, will agree under a penalty of perhaps several
thousand dollars not to enter into competition with his
employer during his whole life, or in the entire German
empire, and sometimes it is said, not anywhere in the
world. When contracts are carefully scrutinized with
respect to their impairment, directly or indirectly, of the
right to make future contracts, it will be found that
many regulations are necessary in the interests of liberty.
Contracting-out as it is now technically called, offers
an interesting illustration of the absolute necessity of
limitations upon contract in the interests of public policy.
It will readily be conceded that private contract must
not stand above public policy, and yet through contract-
ing-out of obligations public policy may frequently, and
will frequently be subverted. Let us suppose it is deter-
mined to be public policy, as it has been determined in
Germany and in England, that accidents to employees,
unless brought about by wilful act of the employee, shall
be regarded as a part of the expenses of manufacturing

INDUSTRIAL LIBERTY.
BY RICHARD T. ELY.
The year 1776 is an epoch-making date in the history
of liberty. Every American associates 1776 with the
Declaration of Independence, which, however we may
look upon it and all modern criticism just and unjust,
to the contrary, notwithstanding-ranks among the
greatest and grandest documents of the world's history.
It is there asserted, as something axiomatic, as some-
thing belonging to the realm of natural law, that liberty
is an inalienable right of all men. You all recall
the precise words: "We hold these truths to be
self-evident; that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pur-
suit of Happiness." It is furthermore asserted that the
very purpose of the institution of government is to
secure these rights, and that every government derives
its just powers from the consent of the governed.
But the year 1776 witnessed the appearance of a book
which so admirably presented the eighteenth century
philosophy of industrial liberty, that by common con-
sent of the intelligent it ranks among the world's
greatest books. I refer to Adam Smith's "Wealth of
Nations", which occupies a pivotal position in modern
economic thought, earlier works preparing the way for
this master-piece, and subsequent works in economics
resting upon the "Wealth of Nations" as a foundation.
So profound has been its influence that the centennial
of its appearance was deemed worthy of a celebration.

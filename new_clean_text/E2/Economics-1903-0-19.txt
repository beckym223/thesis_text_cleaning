conditions on economic theory has been, let us hope,
abundantly demonstrated; but the reciprocal influence
of economic theory on actual conditions is in danger of
being overlooked. For as the science itself becomes
more and more complete, it alone will be in a better
position to apprehend and to explain the real content of
existing conditions and the true method of making the
actual conform to the ideal. Natural science necessarily
moves within the framework of natural forces, but he
who runs may read the lesson of the control of these
same natural forces through modern scientific achieve-
So in the same way economic science, which
is to-day only in its infancy, and which of all disciplines
is the most difficult and the most complicated, is indeed
interlaced with and founded upon the actual conditions
of the time; but, like natural science, the economics of
the future will enable us to comprehend the living
forces at work, and by comprehending will put us in a
position to control them and to mould them to ever
higher uses. Economics is therefore both the creature
and the creator. It is the creature of the past; it is
the creator of the future. Correctly conceived, ade-
quately outlined, fearlessly developed, it is the prop of
ethical upbuilding, it is the basis of social progress.

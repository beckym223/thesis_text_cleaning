Consecration of Cannibalism' ?" 1
On the other hand listen to these words by a sturdy
American whose courage in denunciation of wrong in
high places no one can rightly impugn:
"The competition of economics is not the so-called
competition of our great centers where men strive to
drive men to the wall, but the competition which leaves
each in full possession of that productive power which
best unites his labor with the labor of others.
Competition is no more trespass than it is theft. It is
the reconciliation of men in those productive processes
which issue in the largest aggregate of wealth.
It is not crowding men off their feet, but a means of
planting them upon their feet." "
These quotations could be multiplied indefinitely on
the one side and on the other. We find it asserted on
the one hand that competition is sinful warfare; that
it is "division, disunion, every man for himself, every
man against his brother";³ on the other hand that it is
mutual service; that it is altruism of a superior quality;
that it is the essence of the golden rule; that it is loving
our neighbor as ourselves-in other words, that a correct
rendering of Christian love is competition. *
Apparently such contradictory views admit of no
reconciliation. But when we think seriously about the
matter, we are forced to ask ourselves the question:

unquestioned sincerity, of warm enthusiasm for humanity,
can hold views respecting competition, this

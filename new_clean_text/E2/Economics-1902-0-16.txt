way as to bring contract into conformity with industrial
conditions.
It is in the police power that we find the peculiarly
flexible element in our legal system, and with written
constitutions such as we have it is not easy to see where
otherwise it is to be sought. The possibilities of de-
velopment along the line of the police power cannot be
limited. Consequently, there is the possibility of an
evolution of our law which shall adapt it to our present
and future industrial life, and thus secure industrial
liberty. Let us take, for example, the doctrine that
free contract presupposes "the will as voluntarily mani-
fested." It is quite evident that this must take from
certain agreements the character of a valid contract.
An agreement made by pressure due to threats to a
man's house cannot be a binding contract. Similarly
if I see a millionaire, who is drowning, and offer to save
his life, on condition that he turn over to me all his
property, no court would sustain this agreement as a
binding contract.
But is it not possible in some cases to take into ac-
count the pressure of economic needs, for example,
the hunger of wife and children? Unquestionably,
agreements with wage-earners have been extorted by
the severest pressure of hunger. Agreements for
usurious rates of interest have also been extorted under
the pressure of economic need. Courts have frequently
found a way to declare such agreements of no binding
force. I cannot enlarge upon this thought, and indeed,
have no desire to do more than merely to suggest an
important line of evolution in the interests of liberty.
Let us take again the principle that the right to con-

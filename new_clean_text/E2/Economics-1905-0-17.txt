the community. Where the conditions of intelligence
and ambition are present, material well-being has a
favorable effect of a cumulative kind: a fairly high
standard of living, once set going, tends not only to
maintain itself, but to rise. Something of a lift must
be given before an independent upward movement can
maintain itself. The general rise in the comfort of liv-
ing which the leading countries have secured in the last
half-century, and which has been due largely to cheaper
supplies of food and materials from the new countries,
has served to give the needed lift.
I turn now to that course of reasoning which has long
been among the economists the most effective in favor of
protection; the argument for protection to young indus-
tries. It goes by other names and uses other phrases.
It is sometimes called educating or nurturing protection.
In popular controversy, it takes the form of the conten-
tion that protection, while it may raise temporarily the
prices of the goods protected, in the long run lowers
them. Throughout, it rests on the assumption that a
conntry does not secure without conscious effort or con-
siderable sacrifice those industries which in the long run
are most advantageous for it.
Let us consider first the probable range in the appli-
cation of the principle. It is commonly stated to be
applicable only to manufactured goods, not to raw ma-
terials, including under the term "raw materials"
most agricultural products. Such was the view of
List, the German economist, who has given the most
elaborate and perhaps the most effective statement of
the argument. Indeed, it is only from this point of
view that there is any strong distinction between duties
on manufactures and those on raw materials. No doubt,
something may be said, by way of special objection to

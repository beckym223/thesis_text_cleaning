of without much painstaking and unbiased inquiry,
and for which even such inquiry very likely would yield
no clear-cut answer.
Our conclusions as to the general validity of the ar-
gument for protection to young industries thus have an
uncertain ring. Yet it must be added that while such
protection can not be proved useless, there is at least one
striking phenomenon which proves it to be not indis-
pensable. That phenomenon is found in our own
country. Here we have seen, under a regime of the
most absolute free trade, the gradual and steady growth
of manufactures in communities that a few decades ago
were exclusively agricultural. In our Southern states,
the cotton manufacture has grown and prospered in
face of the competition of the established industry of
New England. It found in the South advantages of
situation, and a labor supply which proved amenable to
profitable exploitation. But these advantages could
not be utilized without an initial period of experiment
and uncertainty, during which the older industry had
all the advantages against which protection is supposed
to be necessary.
Even more instructive is the transfor-
mation of the great Central region,-the states north of
the Ohio and east of the Mississippi. Here we have
seen, under a regime of complete free trade within the
country, the steady growth of manufactures. Where
the field was favorahle for a new industry, whether from
rich natural resources, from advantage in location, or
from ingenuity and enterprise among the leaders of in-
dustry and the rank and file, there the industry has
expanded and flourished, unchecked by the competing
establishments of the older states. Some of the in-
dustries that so sprang up in the Central region have
been of the kind that felt the stimulus of protection

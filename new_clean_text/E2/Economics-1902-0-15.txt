Annual Meeting.
One is the progressive character of the state,
due to general enlightenment; another is the altruistic
spirit of the age, which finds such gratifying expression
in the Old Bay state, and a third is the fact of its high
industrial development, as a result of which it has had
to deal for a longer period than other states with those
questions growing out of an intensive industrial life.
Recently, however, two states, viz., Tennessee and West
Virginia, industrially far less developed, have taken a
leading position in the regulation of contract in the
interests of liberty truly conceived. I refer to the
decisions of the courts of these states, sustaining statutes
prohibiting the maintenance of truck shops, and also
providing for weighing of coal. The courts clearly
recognize inequalities in bargaining power, lying back
of contract, and they also take the position,—and it is undoubtedly
a true one,-that wise legislation of this sort is
calculated to prevent industrial strife, disorder and
bloodshed, and to maintain the public peace.¹
The august tribunal which holds its session in this
city, the Supreme Court of the United States, has also,
on broad grounds of public policy, upheld the statute of
the state of Utah, which limits the working day for
miners in that state to eight hours." The Supreme
Court did not go into the wisdom of this particular
statute, and I have no desire to do so on this occasion.
It is simply the broad principle of regulation of economic
relations in the interests of freedom which is in
question. We see the most enlightened courts thus enmists
and sociologists are the people to whom we ought to turn more
than we do for instruction in the grounds and foundations of all
rational decisions."

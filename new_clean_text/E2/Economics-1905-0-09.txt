see that in so doing they minimize also those conse-
quences of protection which they think bad. The di-
version of labor and capital to less productive channels
-the ill effect which is the essence of the free-trade
contention is precisely in proportion to the range of
industries in which the maintenance of high wages de-
pends on protection. No doubt also the free-traders
do not squarely face the difficulties of a transition to
their system the slowness with which capital and labor
would have to be withdrawn from protected industries,
and the prolonged period of unsettlement which would
have to be undergone before final readjustment.
Before leaving this part of the controversy, I will
note one other aspect of it,-one that touches our pres-
sing social problems. The industries in which labor is
efficient, output is large, and wages are high, are by no
means solely the agricultural industries.
A great
range of manufactures are of this sort; and these are
our most characteristic manufactures. They are the
manufactures employing workmen who are alert, intel-
ligent, and what is popularly called high-priced. They
are the manufactures in which a larger output per unit
of labor and capital comes from ingenious machinery,
effective organization, efficient labor, nicely adjusted
product. Side by side with these are others of a dif-
ferent type, in which the laborer is called on chiefly
for the monotonous repetition of the simplest manual
tasks, and in which even an ignorant man, or woman,
or even child, can be easily taught the task. Here the
temptation is inevitably to seek for cheap labor. The
earth has been scoured to find docile, ignorant, pliable
labor. which shall do for us our Helot's tasks. Inpour-
ing immigrants by the million find work of this kind.
They get wages which are lifted by the surrounding

essentially identical process of economic law. If we sell
the sheep in the market, the tax, so it is said, is indirect;
if we keep the sheep on the farm, and sell only the wool,
we term it a direct or property tax. If a real estate
broker deals in land, the tax on the land as it goes
through his hands is an indirect tax, and presumably
outside of the realm of ability; if he purchases the land,
and sells the wheat, the tax is a direct tax, and to be
judged by the principle of sacrifice.
This is far more than a mere question of nomenclature.
In the one case we follow the working out of economic
law through alterations in values; in the other case we
assume that there are no such changes. In the one
case we regard the social elements in the problem; in
the other, we keep our eyes fixed on the individual ele-
ment. Yet in essence what is the difference? What is
the magic which transmutes a commodity into some-
thing different from a piece of property. A commodity
is an economic concept; property is a legal concept:
at bottom a particular article is nothing but a form of
wealth, and subject to the laws that govern wealth.
Yet the core of economic law is the study of the social
relations of individuals. The entire distinction between
direct and indirect taxes in the sense that in the one
case we have to deal with immediate results, and in the
other with ulterior consequences-this entire distinction
is illusory. In the one case as in the other the conspicu-
ous fact is the social process.
It must indeed not be forgotten that some writers
have in part apprehended this, and have endeavored to
elaborate a universal law of fiscal causation. Adam
Smith and Ricardo were on the right track but their
efforts were largely frustrated by the fact that they cen-
tered their attention upon the shares in distribution;

of politics and of ethics which regards the good of the
whole community as best to be reached by a compromise
between the aims of different sections of the community.
But a profounder study of constitutional history leads
to an opposite conclusion. It shows that parliaments
and congresses, in the really great periods of their
history, have been valuable, not as a field of compromise
between local interests, but of information as to general
ones; not for the consummation of private bargains, but
for the creation of public spirit.
Down to the end of the last century, the English Parliament,
as its name implied, was essentially a place for
discussion. Representatives from different localities
met together at Westminster to interchange views as to
the state of the nation. Each member reported to the
others the feelings and wants of his locality; each received
from his fellow members enlightened views as to
the affairs of the realm as a whole, which he was able to
report at home and make the basis of practical action in
his section of the community. The essential function of
the early parliaments was the creation of a united public
sentiment. They roused the interest of the English
people outside of the sphere of their petty local exigencies,
and enabled them, by common action, to resist the extensions
of the royal prerogative to which, in the absence
of such common action, they must separately have
fallen victims. It is true that the Houses of Parliament
had large functions in addition to this, but they all
group themselves round this central work. Even the
right of the Commons to originate measures of taxation,
so sedulously attacked by the kings, and so jealously
guarded by parliaments, had its chief importance, not
as a means of avoiding the imposition of burdens upon
the people, but as a means of compelling the monarch

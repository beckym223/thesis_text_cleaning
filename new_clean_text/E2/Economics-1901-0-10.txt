would have perished, and that these weak individuals
may take part in the propagation of the species, eventu-
ally leaving behind an enfeebled progeny. But with
all its mildness, civilization lessens unfit reproduction,
and, upon the whole, does so to an ever-increasing ex-
tent. It puts the feeble-minded in asylums, and dis-
courages the marriage of paupers; while in its new atti-
tude towards the criminal classes it shows an increasing
inclination to detain them until it receives evidence
that their malady is cured. Moreover, by sanitation.
and other measures, modern civilization increases the
strength and vigor of those who do survive. Compari-
sons of civilized men with savages and with semi-civil-
ized peoples, reveal the superiority of the former in
physical vigor. It is probable that never in the world's
history have there been men and women whose average
of efficient strength in the economic sphere was so great
as that of the men and women who today inhabit Ger-
many, England, and the United States of America.
Competition is the chief selective process in modern
economic society, and through it we have the survival
of the fit. But what do we mean by "the fit"?
all know today that fitness has reference simply to con-
ditions of a particular time and place. Bold and ag-
gressive pirates were at one time fit for survival, but
now they are likely to come to an untimely and igno-
minious end. Modern society itself establishes, con-
sciously or unconsciously, many of the conditions of the
struggle for existence, and it is for society to create such
economic conditions that only desirable social qualities
shall constitute eminent fitness for survival. A kind of
society is possible, in which the beggar has this fitness,
while the conditions in another society may be most un-
favorable to the growth of parasitical classes.
The socially established competitive methods and the

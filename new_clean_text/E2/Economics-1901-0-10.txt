may take part in the propagation of the species, eventually
leaving behind an enfeebled progeny. But with
all its mildness, civilization lessens unfit reproduction,
and, upon the whole, does so to an ever-increasing extent.
It puts the feeble-minded in asylums, and discourages
the marriage of paupers; while in its new attitude
towards the criminal classes it shows an increasing
inclination to detain them until it receives evidence
that their malady is cured. Moreover, by sanitation.
and other measures, modern civilization increases the
strength and vigor of those who do survive. Comparisons
of civilized men with savages and with semi-civilized
peoples, reveal the superiority of the former in
physical vigor. It is probable that never in the world's
history have there been men and women whose average
of efficient strength in the economic sphere was so great
as that of the men and women who today inhabit Germany,
England, and the United States of America.
Competition is the chief selective process in modern
economic society, and through it we have the survival
of the fit. But what do we mean by "the fit"?
all know today that fitness has reference simply to conditions
of a particular time and place. Bold and aggressive
pirates were at one time fit for survival, but

changed from a wasteful to an economic process. Recent
investigation has disclosed to us the phenomenon of
the silent trade, and has made it clear that the earliest
forms of exchange were inter-tribal, and not intratribal.
It was only after the early hordes or clans had
worked out the system of joint and collective presents
and counterpresents which form the basis of primitive
group barter, that the individual members of the clan
came to recognize the applicability of a similar system
within the group. Private barter is the result of communal
barter, individual trade is an outgrowth of social
trade. The propensity to truck, far from being a natural
and original inclination of the individual, as Adam
Smith thought, is a direct product of social forces. It is
not antecedent, but consequent.
What is true historically is true analytically. If economics
is a science at all, it is a science of values-not
of all values indeed, but of economic values.
of the basic discussions of economic theory are still beclouded
by the inability to distinguish the social character
of value. The favorite study of Robinson Crusoe,
who figures so prominently in the older treatises, is indeed
still useful as affording an illustration of the psychology
underlying all individual choices; but the attempt
to apply these conclusions directly to modern
economic problems is fraught with peril, because the
economic life of to-day rests not on Robinson Crusoe conditions,
but on social conditions. I have elsewhere
called attention to the fact that the contest still raging
between the partisans of the cost theory and of the utility
theory of value is at bottom based on a misconception,
and with your permission I shall spend just a moment
in recalling this rather technical point to your
minds.

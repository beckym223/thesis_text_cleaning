absorption and remaking of these unskilled and unedu-
cated masses is largely a question of degree. A certain
amount we can make over; too many of them would
swamp our institutions. No thinking man can view
without concern the rapid increase in their numbers, or
believe that it is for our social or moral advantage to
add by legislative policy to the range of industries which
create a demand for them.
I pass now to more difficult matters: to some phases
of the controversy concerning which economists are
much less in accord, and on which something is to be
said on both sides. And here I will begin with two
lines of reasoning that are not commonly considered to-
gether, but which seem to me to involve essentially the
same question of principle. One of them is the argu-
ment against dumping; the other is the argument for
the protection of agricultural products against the com-
petition of new countries.
"Dumping" I take to mean the disposal of goods
in foreign countries at less than normal price. It can
take place, as a long-continued state of things, only
where there is some diversion of industry from the usual
conditions of competition. It may be the result of an
export bounty, enabling goods to be sold in foreign
countries at a lower price than at home. It may be the
result of a monopoly or effective combination, which is
trying to keep prices within a country above the com-
petitive point. Such a combination may find that its
whole output can not be disposed of at these prices, and
may sell the surplus in a free market at anything it will
fetch, always provided it yields the minimum of what
Professor Marshall happily calls "prime cost.‚Äù
Now, if this sort of thing goes on indefinitely, I con-
fess that I am unable to see why it can be thought a

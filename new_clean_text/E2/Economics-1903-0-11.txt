Africa and in the tropical islands of Asia that the con-
ditions are still favorable to slavery. Were they to
form so controlling a part of the empire as in former
days in the colonies of Greece and Rome, the present
struggle in England, Holland, Germany, and the United
States to solve the labor problem in the dependencies
without recourse to compulsion would be far less likely
of accomplishment. It is because the entirely different
economic systems and consequent social ethics of the
mother countries are now the potent factors in the world.
that we can confidently look forward to the speedy pass-
ing of slavery in every part of the globe. Morality, in-
deed, is doing its noble work, but at bottom lies the
disappearance of free land.
Secondly, the predominance of industrial capital.
Some thinkers, from Phaleas of old to the Henry George
and Loria of to-day, ascribe all our social troubles to
landed conditions. Others, like Demolins in France and
Brooks Adams at home, tell us that the commercial
route is the secret of prosperity and decadence. There
is a certain degree of truth in each of these contentions
as an explanation of the past. Both classes of thinkers,
however, fail to recognize the essential changes brought
about by modern industrialism. The conditions of land-
holding undoubtedly played a dominant r√¥le in Rome,
as they did in feudal Europe and colonial America.
The control of the trade routes was assuredly the chief
factor in the rise and fall of the oriental monarchies, of
the Greek city states, of the Italian and German towns,
of Portugal and Spain. But why is this? Clearly be-
cause of the absence of industrial capital. In the one
case the economic system was based on the ascendency.
of land as a factor in production; in the other case on
the equal or even superior force of commercial capital.

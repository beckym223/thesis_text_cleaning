economic forces somewhat above the level of similar
wages in Europe, but are lifted by no means up to the
full American range. They are in a class by them-
selves, cut off in large degree from the general influ-
ences of the country. Their children, indeed, com-
monly feel these influences. They go to the public
schools, learn the American standards and ways, and
struggle with more or less success to rise to a higher
stratum. But this depletion of the lower ranks is more
than made good by the increasing arrivals of new
shoals of immigrants. Thus we have, perhaps not per-
manently, but as a continuing part of our present
social system, a vast mass of human beings doing for
low wages work that is dull, monotonous, and accord-
ing to our standards ill-paid.
Now I am by no means disposed to assert that the
protected industries are identical with the industries.
employing labor of this sort. Not a few of the protected
industries call for labor of the alert and intelligent kind.
Many industries which have nothing to do with protec-
tion call for the dull, weary, unskilled work. Such is
the mining of anthracite coal, whose peculiar condi-
tions have of late been so conspicuously brought into
notice; such is the cotton manufacture in the South,
where during the last twenty years a vein of this low-
lying human material has been unexpectedly discovered
and exploited. But a good share of the protected man-
ufactures are in this class. Large parts of the textile
manufactures in the Atlantic States belong here, and
are in marked contrast,―to give one example,―to such
an industry as the shoe manufacture. I cannot but be-
lieve that by increasing the opportunities for the utili-
zation of labor of this sort the protective system has
added to our social and political difficulties. The safe

that men should be called upon to discharge their obli-
gations to government in accordance with the benefit
they receive from it-or whether with the newer writers
we accept the doctrine that taxes should be levied in
proportion to the ability of the tax-payer-in both cases
alike the starting point and the goal of the discussion is
the individual. This of course does not mean that these
doctrines equally rest upon what might be called the
atomic doctrine of the state. On the contrary, it is a
matter of common knowledge that while the benefit.
theorists accept that conception of government which
has been described as "anarchy plus the policeman"
the faculty theorists on the contrary count in their
ranks the advocates of radical social reform and even
most of the socialists themselves.
The point that it is desired to emphasize, however, is
that both schools are individualistic in the sense that
their conception of justice in taxation revolves about the
burden resting on the original individual who pays the
taxes, and disregards the subtler consequences of the
economic law that governs the transaction. Just as the
benefit theorists think only of the advantages accruing
to the individual, so the faculty theorists are primarily
concerned with the problem of equal sacrifice as between
individuals, with the exemption of the individual mini-
mum of subsistence, and with the scheme of graduated
taxation as between individuals. They, like the others,
have in mind first and foremost the individual.
Now, there are two remarkable facts connected with
this modern development of fiscal theory. In the first

theories and the application of the theories. My distin-

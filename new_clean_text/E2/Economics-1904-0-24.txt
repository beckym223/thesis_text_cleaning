member of the community. We shall then grasp
the fact that while equality from the individual point of
view means equality as abstracted from class differentiation,
equality from the social point of view means
equality only within the class, and is compatible with
an ostensible inequality between the classes. For here
as elsewhere, all is not what it doth seem, and the
apparent original inequality, when subjected to the
crucible of social analysis and social process, resolves
itself into a higher equality.
In conclusion, then, let us not minimize the revolutionary
character of the general principle which is the
burden of my theme. I submit it indeed with diffidence,
but with a firm conviction that if true it is destined to
lead to important results. If the social aspect of economic
law is really as significant as I think it is, we
must rebuild large parts of our economic edifice. We
must recognize that the psychological school of economics
has gone off on a wrong tack, not because they
emphasize psychology, but because their psychology is
not of the right kind; we shall have to confess that the
opposition between the cost theorists and the utility
theorists, is to a great extent needless; we shall have to
revise our attitude to the problems of international trade,
of private property, of the relations of labor and capital;
and above all, we shall be compelled to rewrite our
works on Taxation and Finance.
Let me trust, however, that there will be no miscon
ception of the real bearing of my contention. The subordination
of the individual to the social element in
economic life and law does not imply any depreciation
of the individual as such, nor does it mean that the ideal
polity of the future must resemble the crude socialism
that is so loudly proclaimed by some. For all human
beings, after all, the goal of endeavor must be the perfection

the farmers; we have the class of men engaged in
transportation; the men who work for wages; all with
their special needs and peculiarities, finding expression
in laws applicable to the class to which they belong.
To use expression of Judge Cooley in his Coustitu-
tional Limitations, we have here simply the recognition
of "distinctions that exist in the nature of things".
It would be interesting, if time permitted, to show
how many different kinds of legal inequality there may
be where we have nominal legal equality. I can refer
here only briefly to one or two points. We have
inequality in power to secure needed laws. Conse-
quently we have societies and social action in order to
secure needed legislation for those who by themselves.

and by social action, in which many of the men of
Baltimore, most eminent in church and state and in
private fields, participated, a twelve hour day was
secured.
There is inequality on account of the knowledge of
law on the part of the various classes, and in the power
to avail one's self of the law. Consequently, we have
societies formed to remedy this evil, and to promote that
liberty which comes from balanced powers. We have
our bureaus of justice, and our legal aid societies.

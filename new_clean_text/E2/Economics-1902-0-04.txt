It is but one step from Herbert Spencer to philo-
sophical anarchy which, in the interests of liberty, would
abolish the state altogether. We thus reach the ter-
mination of one line of logical evolution of liberty, con-
ceived negatively, as something which may exist if
political restraints and restrictions upon action are once
removed. Very early, however, those whose interests.
led them to approach social and economic questions
from a different point of view, as well as those who
examined the problem of liberty more broadly and
deeply, began to qualify the theory of liberty which we
have just examined. John Stuart Mill occupies an in-
teresting position in the development of the philosophy
of liberty, as in him we see radically antagonistic views
struggling with each other for mastery. He was
brought up a firm adherent of the eighteenth century
social philosophy, but was obliged to qualify it increas-
ingly, as he grew older and gained larger knowledge as
a result of broadening experience and deeper thought.
On the one hand, in the interests of liberty he would
prohibit life-long marriage contracts. On the other
hand, he sees the limitations imposed upon freedom of
action in the social and economic order, and looks for-
ward to a time of collective ownership of land and
capital, although he does not profess to see how this
collective ownership is to be managed so as to avoid new
restrictions upon liberty.
Another stage in the development of thought is
clearly reached in the writings of the English philoso-
pher, Thomas Hill Green,' who breaks away altogether
from the conception of liberty as something to be
achieved by negative, political action, holding that true
'T. H. Green, â€œLiberal legislation and freedom of contract".

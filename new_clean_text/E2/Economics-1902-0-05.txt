liberty means the expression of positive powers of the
individual, and that it can be reached only as a result
of a long and arduous constructive process. Green tells
us in these words what he means by liberty or freedom:
"We do not mean merely freedom from restraint or
compulsion. We do not mean merely freedom to do as
we like irrespectively of what it is that we like. We
do not mean a freedom that can be enjoyed by one man,
or one set of men, at the cost of a loss of freedom to
others. When we speak of freedom as something to be
highly prized, we mean a positive power or capacity of
doing or enjoying something worth doing or enjoying,
and that, too, something that we do or enjoy in common
with others. We mean by it a power which each man
exercises through the help or security given him by his
fellowmen, and which he in turn helps to secure for
them. When we measure the progress of a society by
the growth in freedom, we measure it by the increasing
development and exercise on the whole of those powers
of contributing to social good with which we believe
the members of the society to be endowed; in short,
by the greater power on the part of the citizens as a
body to make the most and best of themselves."
As anarchy gives us the logical outcome of one line
of thought concerning liberty, so we find another line
of thought, regarding liberty, going far beyond the
necessary implications of Green's position and terminat-
ing in the opposite extreme, socialism.
As Adam Smith's philosophy of liberty is an expres-
sion of the eighteenth century, Thomas Hill Green's
view may be looked upon as an expression of the
philosophy of liberty with which the twentieth century
opens. There are various reasons for this change of
view. One of the most fundamental is, perhaps, found

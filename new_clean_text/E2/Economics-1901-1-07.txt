aid of that developed and disciplined intellect, which
the severe training of the present courses secures. Fur-
thermore, it was doubtful whether it was a good idea
for a young man to go to college who intended to go
into business, since he would be wasting on college
benches the very years he needed most for learning the
details of his future calling; and more important than
all, there was no well defined curriculum, which a col-
lege could conscientiously recommend to a young man
as worth his while to take, at all similar in character to
the courses in law, medicine, or theology.
These arguments, combined with the lack of money
to undertake new functions, have kept most of our in-
stitutions from organizing such departments up to the
present.
The answer to the first argument is simple. The fact
that there are many men who take now a college course
and then go into business,â€”it is claimed, I believe, that
over 30 per cent. of the Yale graduates do, as a matter
of fact, go into commercial life-does not prove that
these men prefer such a course to one better adapted to
their needs; and still less does it prove that there are
not hundreds and thousands of young men in the coun-
try who do not at present go to college at all, but who
would go if they felt that they could get something of
more immediate benefit to them than the old-fashioned
curricula, or the old-fashioned studies. It is doubtless
true that if the only higher institution in the community
were a law school, many young men would take this
course, even though their purpose were to practice med-
icine; but this does not prove that a law school is
the best, or even a good course of preparation for medi-
cine, nor that the demand for medical education is fully
met by the law school.

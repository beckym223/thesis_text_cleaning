Does the theory of competition give ground for the
view that a struggle between different parts for their
class interests, works out in an ecomomic harmony?
Not at all. It shows, on the contrary, that struggles
within each class, antagonistic for the moment to the
apparent interests of that class, so conduce to the inter-

struggles of different men for themselves, would furnish
a reasonable basis of adjustinent, or compromise, with
those in different positions. What the champion of
competition holds, is rather that the struggles of each
man for himself prevent others, who are in a similar
position, from taking undue advantage over their fellow
men. It is not a conflict between classes, but a conflict
within classes, which he seeks to perpetuate; and he
would perpetuate it because he can prove, or thinks
that he can prove, that it conduces to a common interest
more wide and more lasting than those which the indi-
vidual classes, if organized into trusts or trades unions,
would seek to pursue.

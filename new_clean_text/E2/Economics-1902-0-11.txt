which determines or regulates in any way the relations.

movement at some point, but where it is wise it increases
it more than correspondingly at other points. If
we have restriction upon liberty called 2a, we have in
the case of wise, social action an increment of liberty.
which is certainly 2a plus something else. The employer
may not hire the services of little children, and
his liberty to do so is restricted, but the liberty of the
children is increased. They are freed from toil, and when
provision is made for their wise education and up-bringing,
their powers are increased, and they have many

their fellows for their own benefit.
We thus have a vast body of legislation in and
through which society seeks liberty. This legislation
modifies and qualifies nominally free contract, because
nominally free contract may mean servitude of various
kinds and various degrees. The aim is the increase of
liberty in the positive sense.
Education is one of the lines along which modern
society works to secure liberty. It cultivates and enlightens
the mind, frees it from enslaving superstition;
and, where it is industrial, it cultivates economic
powers and aids us in adjusting ourselves in the relations
of complex economic society.
Modern legislation, even reluctantly and against the
force of prejudice, recognizes increasingly the existence
of classes, and the inequalities of powers among human
beings. We have one great class in the community,
children, for whom we have special laws. Women are
another great class, with a nature different from that of
men, and with special needs of their own.
We have

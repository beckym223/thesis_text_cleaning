Social Aspects of Economic Law

If we apply this doctrine to our problem, we are con-
fronted by this situation. Take a tax on land, for in-
stance. In the case of agricultural land, provided that
in practice real estate is the well nigh exclusive, or at
least the preponderant form, of property assessed, the tax
is either shifted by being added to the price of the pro-
duct or, where conditions do not allow this, it is capi-
talized into a lower selling value of the land, and when
the land changes hauds the new purchaser buys himself
free of tax. Thus in the course of time the tax is dif-
fused through capitalization or shifting. In city real
estate the same is true; either rents will go up, or prices
of lots will go down, and in the end the community as a
whole bears the burden.
Again, take personal property. In the case of mort-
gages it is now fairly well understood that a tax on the
man who lends the money does not remain on him, but
leads to an increase in the rate of interest, with all kinds
of ulterior effects on building operations, and on the
general fiscal and economic welfare of society. With
personal property invested in corporate securities, the
same results arise not only from shifting, but also from
capitalization. In the case of the railway bond, men-
tioned above, the new purchaser does not suffer, but
neither does the shipper, provided any dividends at all
are earned. But in the case of railway stocks, the de-
pression of market price that would follow the imposi-
tion of the tax might result in limiting the investment
of new capital to such an extent as to diminish facilities
or to raise rates. In the one case we would have capi-
talization, in the other, shifting. But in neither case
would there be any permanent burden on the individual
security-holder who purchases after the imposition of
the tax.

If we apply this doctrine to our problem, we are confronted
by this situation. Take a tax on land, for instance.
In the case of agricultural land, provided that
in practice real estate is the well nigh exclusive, or at
least the preponderant form, of property assessed, the tax
is either shifted by being added to the price of the product
or, where conditions do not allow this, it is capitalized
into a lower selling value of the land, and when
the land changes hauds the new purchaser buys himself
free of tax. Thus in the course of time the tax is diffused
through capitalization or shifting. In city real
estate the same is true; either rents will go up, or prices
of lots will go down, and in the end the community as a
whole bears the burden.
Again, take personal property. In the case of mortgages
it is now fairly well understood that a tax on the
man who lends the money does not remain on him, but
leads to an increase in the rate of interest, with all kinds
of ulterior effects on building operations, and on the
general fiscal and economic welfare of society. With
personal property invested in corporate securities, the
same results arise not only from shifting, but also from
capitalization. In the case of the railway bond, mentioned
above, the new purchaser does not suffer, but
neither does the shipper, provided any dividends at all
are earned. But in the case of railway stocks, the depression
of market price that would follow the imposition
of the tax might result in limiting the investment
of new capital to such an extent as to diminish facilities
or to raise rates. In the one case we would have capitalization,
in the other, shifting. But in neither case
would there be any permanent burden on the individual
security-holder who purchases after the imposition of
the tax.

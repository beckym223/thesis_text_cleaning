matters worse, because this delusion prevents him from
recognizing the need of applying outside correctives to
his judgment, and often leads him to impugn the fair-
ness of anybody else who suggests such correctives.
Why not, under these circumstances, admit freely the
difficulty under which we labor in making objective
judgments? Why not recognize from the first that each
of us represents a locality or a class, and that the moral
judgment of each observer is sure to be affected and to
some degree distorted by his own personal prepossessions?
Such a course, frankly adopted, its advocates claim, will
keep the bad men from hypocrisy, the good men from
self-deception, and the large number of men who are
neither very good nor very bad from that mixture of
hypocrisy and self-deception which contrives to combine
all the evils of them both.
We are told, in the second place, as a wholly independ-
ent line of argument, that an attempt on the part of the
economist to represent the total interest of the public,
even if in a few cases of eminent mental and moral en-
dowment, like John Stuart Mill, it proved approxi-
mately possible, would not be good politics. The as-
sumption by an economist that he represents the total
interest of the community rather than the interest of
some one part or class in that community, exposes him
to the suspicion of being either a pharisee or a hypocrite
- either a man who over-estimates his own righteous-
ness, or one who pretends to a righteousness which he
does not possess.
If either of these titles is a just one,
it interferes with a man's success as a political reformer.
If it is even suspected to be just, it will prove a heavy
weight around his neck. Even if a man believes him-
self to be wholly free from either hyprocisy or phari-
saism, it is a wise measure for him to keep out of the

more easily turned into realities by a period of shelter
from foreign, especially English, competition. During
the last third of the century, Germany's industrial
growth has been one of the remarkable phenomena of
our time; but it began under the moderate protectionist
regime of the Zollverein, and, whether or no promoted
also by the accentuated protection that began in 1879,
has certainly been much affected by the other factors
also, to some of which I shall presently refer. In the
United States we find similarly conflicting evidence.
Some researches of my own have led me to believe that,
on the whole, the first growth of manufactures in this
country, in the early years of the nineteenth century,
was advantageously promoted by restrictions on competing
imports. As we come nearer to the present time,
the case in favor of protection becomes more and more
doubtful. In the policy of extreme and all-embracing
protection which has been gradually built up since the
Civil War, it would have been surprising indeed if we
had not scored a few hits. Where you send innumerable
shots promiscuously in a given direction, some few
of them are likely to hit the mark. But specific and
unbiassed inquiry on those points is sadly needed, and
offers a promising opportunity for scholarly investigation.
It is obvious that there has been not only an
enormous growth of manufacturing industry, but a great
improvement in methods of production and a growing
independence of foreign competition. How far this
gain has been carried to the point which proves that
the community is now better off than it would be if it
had depended on foreign supply; and how far such a
gain, further, may have been due to causes quite independent
of encouragement in the way of protection, â€”
these are questions which certainly can not be disposed

ascribed to the financial exigencies of that crisis, and
might reasonably be expected before long to give way
once more to a moderate policy.
How different since then has been the course of events
from what was confidently expected by the economists
of 1860! Slowly but steadily the current has been reversed,
and country after country has joined the protectionist
ranks. The United States, so far from relaxing
the high duties imposed during the civil war, has
strengthened them and enlarged their range, and gradually
built up a protective system the like of which was
not dreamed of in earlier days. France, restive under
the treaty regime of low duties, finally put an end to it
in 1881, and then proceeded to build up once more a
system of high protection. Germany took her decisive
step in the same direction in 1879, and thereafter proceeded
steadily to enlarge and elaborate her tariff barriAustria
and Italy followed suit, and Russia has
gone to the extreme in adopting protection. Even the
old strongholds of free trade have become difficult to
hold. Holland's latest tariff, while still disavowing deliberate
protection, yet levies duties which, if ostensibly
for financial yield, are inconsistent with a strict adherence
to free trade. The leading English colonies,
Canada and Australia, have ostentatiously abandoned
that principle. England herself is in the throes of a
discussion in which her policy of freedom, supposed to
have been settled once for all, is attacked with vigor and
effect; and who shall say what is to be the outcome of
that discussion?

Not less striking is the change in temper among economic
thinkers. The whole structure of economic
theory is undergoing revision. Many of the doctrines
of Adam Smith and Ricardo have no more than an historic

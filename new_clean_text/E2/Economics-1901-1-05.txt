American Economic Association.
As a result of this and other circumstances, it comes
about that every American institution is compelled to
ask itself "Am I doing for the community all that can
be reasonably expected of me?" "Am I working
properly the whole field which naturally belongs to me
and which I must work if the highest interests of the
community are to be subserved?"
In answer to this question, kept perpetually before
our higher institutions, among other forces, as already
suggested, by the chronic need of money characteristic of
them one and all, we have seen an unexpected and enor-
mous expansion of our American college and university
system. It was natural that when the college began to
emerge into the university it should undertake first of
all to provide for the education of those classes, which
by long tradition in the Old World had come to look
upon the universities as their institutions par excellence,
viz., law, medicine, and theology. The profession of
teaching was taken care of, partly by the fact that many
of the positions were filled only by clergymen, and
partly by the fact that the community was long satis-
fied with the incidental preparation for teaching, which
a man could obtain by completing the ordinary college
course. With the development of graduate schools the
profession of teaching received its special faculty. In
the meantime, the university was developing in other
directions, viz., those of offering special training for the
dentist, veterinary surgeon, farmer and engineer, and
thus a large number of new callings was brought within
the charmed circle of those for whose preparation the
university exists.
It was plain to the student of education that if there
was a class left in the community whose members
needed or desired special higher training, and for whom.

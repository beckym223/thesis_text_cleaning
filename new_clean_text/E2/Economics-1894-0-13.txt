ing that the act of 1894 will be able to secure the full dis-
closure at which it aims. Doubtless large sums will be
collected under it, for the field to be reaped is wide and
rich. But it is altogether improbable that the assessment
will approach completeness or uniformity, or that the ad-
ministration of the tax by the United States will escape
the progressive demoralization which takes place when
conscientious tax-payers find that others are shirking the
burden which was intended for all.

No doubt the acknowledgment that the tax-payer's dec-

corrected by the best information at the command of the

provisions for collecting the tax in all possible cases from
the source of the income instead of its recipient, and this

would, however, give us in all probability as close an ap-
proximation as the present condition of our part of the
world will allow, which is, in fact, all that can be secured
in practice under any system, however rigid and precise
we may make the letter of the law.
The obvious advantage to be gained by taxing income at

tax in relatively large amounts, is that the assessment is
made in the quarter where there is the least temptation to
concealment. The companies or persons paying the rent,
interest, or dividends which are to be taxed, independently
of their openness to inspection, are not actuated by the
same motives as the individual who is called upon to return
the amount of his income. It is with a wise perception of

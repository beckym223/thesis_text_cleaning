a sense far different from that which the accidental ap-
plication of this word has carried with it,-a thing in-
volving a delegation of power by the public to the hands
of a few men, which they are able, if they please, to
misuse to the detriment of others without being im-
mediately overtaken by any legal or commercial penalty.
That they will themselves suffer in the long run from
such misuse of powers entrusted, is very probably true;
but the reaction upon them is so indirect that we can-
not rely upon it as a protection to commercial society.
in the way that we could rely on everyday competition
in the smaller and more individualized business of fifty
years ago. The correctives to the abuse of individual
selfishness in the commercial world today are so much
less immediate and automatic than they once were that
very few persons now preach unlimited competition as
a means of promoting the general good. So marked,
indeed, is this reaction that there is danger of our hav-
ing too little confidence in individual initiative in the
immediate future, and of regulating these trusts by ex-
ercise of public authority, which may prove in the long
run less wise than private enterprise itself.
A similar change is taking place in matters political
as well as industrial. Not only are our municipalities
giving examples of combined action in the way of pub-
lic works undreamed of a century ago, but our nations as
a whole are undertaking yet larger combinations in the
shape of colonial empires. What will be the ultimate
result of this last change of national character it is far
too early to predict; but this is certain: that it will
necessarily be accompanied by a recognition of the fact
that public office is a public trust more fully than it has
been recognized in the past. A federation of states of
approximately equal strength may govern one another

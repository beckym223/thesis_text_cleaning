and foreign markets, rejected though they have been in
all respectable economic writing, emerge again and
again. They will not down, and create a set of prepos-
sessions favorable to the adoption of protectionist legis-
lation. But in European countries (for the moment, I
have not the United States in mind) its actual adoption
has been immensely promoted by two other factors. One
is the competition of new countries in agricultural pro-
ducts. The other is the growth and intensification of
national feeling.
The effect of the competition of new countries is ob-
vious enough. With the cheapening of transportation,
not only England, but France, Germany, and the other
countries of Western Europe, have been invaded by sup-
plies of cheaper food and raw materials. The agricul-
tural classes have felt the pressure of foreign competition-
Formerly indifferent or even hostile to high tariffs, they
have now been led to join in the demand for protection
against cheaper foreign supplies. In England the agri-
cultural interest has always been restive under free
trade. In France and Germany, with the new demo-
cratic conditions, its influence now constitutes a strong
political force against the application of that doctrine.
Not less important, however, is the sentiment of
nationality and its unfortunate counterpart, to the senti-
ment against foreigners. Of the ennobling and bene-
ficent effect of national feeling I need not here speak.
Its less favorable aspects unfortunately are most con-
spicuous in relation to our present subject. Cobden and
the other English free-traders of half-a-century ago looked
forward to a coming era of peace among nations,
strengthened by the links of friendly exchange and
mutual benefit. How sadly have these hopes been dis-
appointed? Militarism is no less strong than it was,

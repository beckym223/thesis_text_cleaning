his fellow members of the community; that in this field
of exceptional doubt he should undertake to realize the
very highest ideals as a scientific man who stands above
the clouds of prejudice, and therefore sees farther than
those about him; that it is his high mission to be the
representative and the champion of the permanent interests
of the whole community, in the face of conflicting
claims from representatives of temporary or partial
ones.
This view of the mission and the duties of the political
economist has been challenged on three grounds: as
bad psychology, bad politics, and bad ethics. We are
told, in the first place, that as a matter of practical psychology,
no man can make his judgment as to national
well-being independent of his social antecedents and his
ethical training. If he has grown up among soldiers,
he will have one set of standards; if he has grown np
among business men, he will have a second; if he has
grown up among literary men, he will have a third; if
he has grown up among laborers, he will have a fourth.
Strive as he may to disassociate himself from the effects
of education and environment, he can at best be but
partially successful. His political vision suffers not
only from nearsightedness, but from astigmatism. He
may correct the former; no power on earth can enable
him to correct the latter, or even to gain an objective
estimate of its effects. Robert Malthus was a disinterested
man, and so was Henry George; yet in neither
case was such disinterestedness sufficient to protect them
from obliquities of moral vision which led to diametrically
opposite conclusions as to the conditions of public
prosperity. A man may have the intention to be impartial,
and may be perfectly candid in the belief that
he has carried out this intention; but that only makes

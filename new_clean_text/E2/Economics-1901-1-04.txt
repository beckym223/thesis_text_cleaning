If other European countries have not as yet given as
distinct an endorsement to the view that universites
should undertake this function, it is largely because of
the existence in those countries of certain high grade
commercial colleges, which satisfy the demand fairly
well, and because of the heavy-footed gate of their uni-
versities in general when any innovation is proposed.
With us, on the contrary, circumstances are different.
On the one hand we had and have no separate commer-
cial schools of high rank; that is, of college or univer-
sity grade; and on the other, our colleges and universities
are in a position to respond more quickly to special
public needs than those of Europe. Our system of
higher education has many defects, but one of its ad-
vantages lies in its close touch with the common life of
the people. This acts in some ways as a hindrance,
since it tends to keep the intellectual level of the insti-
tution near that of the average of the community; and
this sometimes means near to a dead level of mediocrity.
But the scheme has at any rate the virtue of its defects.
The steady and continued dependence upon the public
for funds makes these institutions quickly respon-
sive to the real needs of the community. Our device
of governing boards-non-expert bodies of business and
professional men--renders this contact between the peo-
ple and higher institutions all the easier and more
vital, and through these boards-responsible directly or
indirectly for the funds necessary to keep the institu-
tions going the life blood of the community can pul-
sate into the very arteries of college and university life;
thus, to some extent, preventing that stiffening and
exclusiveness, that Phariseeism, which is the ever pres-
ent danger of all higher institutions of learning, and
especially of those which are self-governing bodies.

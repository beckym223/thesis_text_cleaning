in the way of advantage in other directions, or some-
thing which in itself brings an advantage? The es-
sence of the doctrine of free trade is that prima facie
international trade brings a gain, and that restrictions
on it presumably bring a loss. Departure from this
principle, though by no means impossible of justification,
need to prove their case; and if made in view of the
pressure of opposing principles, they are matter for re-
gret. In this sense, the doctrine of free trade, however
widely rejected in the world of politics, holds its own
in the sphere of the intellect.

does not bear the tax. As the original holders gradually
sell out, the tax in time comes to rest on no individual
at all.
The shifting of a tax is not much more complicated,
as a conception at least. If a special levy, for instance,
is imposed upon houses and reduces the income of
the owner, there will in ordinary circumstances be a
cessation in house building until with the progress of
population rents rise. But if rents rise, the manufact-
urer or merchant who occupies the structure will be
compelled to charge more for his wares; and if these
wares are the raw materials for some other product, the
rise will be successively transferred from one operation
to another until it loses itself in the prices paid by the
ultimate consumer.
The
Let us now combine these two conceptions.
older doctrine of shifting led to the so-called diffusion
theory; the newer doctrine of capitalization leads to
what I would call the absorption theory. For in such
cases the tax is not diffused, but absorbed. Whether,
however, the tax is diffused or absorbed, the burden on
the individual who comes to be the permanent owner of
property ultimately vanishes. The combination of the
diffusion and of the absorption theories of taxation re-
sults in what I should like to call the final disappear-
ance theory. That is, in all cases where a man parts
with his property or with the produce of his property or
his earnings and in modern economic life this is more
and more overwhelmingly the rule,â€”the tax finally dis-
appears as a permanent burden on the individual on
whom it is sought to be imposed; although, of course, it
does not disappear in its effects, often unlooked for, on the
economic progress of society as a whole, or of the various
social classes in particular.

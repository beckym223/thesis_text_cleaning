trial laws to be effective must deal with them as they
exist in classes. And, moreover, no class exists for
itself. As society becomes real and vital, and means
more and more to us all, it becomes apparent that no one
class exists for itself, and that no one class can exist
apart from all other classes. While there is such a thing
as vicious legislation in behalf of a few favored individuals,
whatever promotes the interests of any one of the great
and numerous classes in society, either in matters physical,
mental, moral or spiritual, advances the interests of
every other class. "We are members one of another," and
"the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of
thee nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of
and whether one member suffers, all the
members suffer with it or one member be honored all
the members rejoice with it". The apostle Paul gives in
in these words an expression to a deep principle of modern
industrial society, the principle of social solidarity.
I have sketched thus hastily a theory of industria
liberty. What I have said, I would have looked upon
as thoughts on industrial liberty, more or less closely
connected. I have not even attempted an exhaustive
treatment, for which my time is too limited, even had I,
as I have not, the wisdom for a complete presentation.
I trust, however, that what I have presented is in
harmony with industrial evolution and truth. It is
something, at any rate, if I have at least made it clear
that industrial liberty is a conception having a relative
and not an absolute value; that it is to be conceived in
a positive rather than in a negative sense; that it is not
something which can be decreed off-hand, by any legislative
body, but rather that it is a social product, to be
achieved by individuals working socially together, and
that it comes, not all at once, but slowly as the result of
a long continued and arduous process. It is not the beginning
of social evolution, but rather one of the goals

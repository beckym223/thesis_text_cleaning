1898, when it opened a College of Commerce and Politics.
The University of California began similar work in its
College of Commerce in August, and the University of
Ohio in September of the same year. Columbia University
worked out a plan for a four-years' college
course in the year 1899, which will be put into working
operation as soon as funds can be obtained.
the year 1900 the following institutions inaugurated
the work Dartmouth College, in the Amos Tuck
School of Administration and Finance; the University
of Vermont, in its Department of Commerce
and Economics; New York University, in its School
of Commerce, Accounts and Finance; the University
of Michigan, in its Special Courses in Higher
Commercial Education and Public Administration; and
the University of Wisconsin, in its School of Commerce."
The University of Illinois has requested the legislature
for an annual appropriation of $17,500 to defray the expenses
of such a department, and it is announced that
the University of Iowa will make a similar request.
Now what is the real force underlying this movement
and what is the cause of this sudden, and to many people,
unexpected acceleration within the last three years?
What ground is there to suppose that this progress is to
continue in the future?
The explanation of this remarkable advance is found,
in my opinion, in two circumstances-a growing recognition
on the part of our colleges that there is a wide
and unexploited field open to them, which it is their
duty to occupy and cultivate, and at the same time a
growing demand for higher education in our business
classes themselves and a consequent turning of their attention
toward the existing centers of higher education

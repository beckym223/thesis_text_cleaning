when a prosperous business swells our imports, and sometimes
a dearth when the course of trade changes; but in
neither case have we any important elastic branch of taxation,
which can be relied upon to lower a surplus or fill
up a deficit at short notice. Neither customs nor excise
duties can be used for this purpose without serious disturbance
and friction. England, as is well known, meets
the analogous difficulty caused by fluctuations, not in
her receipts, but in her expenditures-by the adjustment
of the income tax. Continental writers and statesmen
have long pointed with envy to this unfailing resource of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer. With a tax for which
the administrative machinery is permanent, but the rate
is fixed for only one year at a time, it is easy and usual,
even after the fiscal year has begun, to meet unexpected
changes in affairs by a change in this variable element
of revenue, a change which takes instant effect. This
use of the income tax, together with the power given to
the government to borrow on short time in anticipation
of receipts, is, in large part, the explanation of the singularly
close calculation and the small balances of cash
with which the English Exchequer is habitually managed.
The circumstances of the United States, and the unavoidable
difference in our leading sources of taxation, make it
unlikely that this generation or the next will see any
similar administrative success here; but a much closer
adjustment of revenue to actual needs than we have at
present could be attained by the use of a well-arranged.
and quickly movable tax on incomes, as a part of our
ordinary revenue. Thus a proper income tax appears to
have uses which make it desirable to have its practicability
more carefully studied.
When we pass from the case of ordinary revenue, and
consider the sources of supply for emergencies, a well-constituted
income tax has a still greater importance. Even

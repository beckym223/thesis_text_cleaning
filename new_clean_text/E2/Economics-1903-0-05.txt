of the ancient Jews and of the classic Greeks
toward gentile and barbarian respectively as the perfectly
explicable, but none the less culpable, result of an
overweening pride and vainglory, buttressed in the one
case by the all-pervading power of religion, and in the

neighbors, there may possibly be at all events a mote in
our own.
When, however, we come to a consideration of economic
phenomena and their influence on our social and
political fact and theory, we do not recognize that we
have been largely living in a fool's paradise. We think
with complacency that there is something inherent in
our democracy; we look back upon the achievements of

New England indeed developed its democracy and its
town meeting. But the town meeting had its prototype
in the woods of Germany, on the steppes of Asia, and in

tection of a common law. According to this view, the
man who would sink the interest of a class in a supposed
general public interest, is but depriving that class
of its own natural safeguard in the struggle for existence.
If it works for itself it gets what it can-sometimes
more than it ought, sometimes less than it ought; but in
a reasonably well-ordered civil society it takes its chances

general good, omits to pursue its own group interest, it

conceptions with which it has identified itself. Let us
have fair play; let us have a fair chance for conflicting
views to struggle one with another, as a condition of
progress for the whole society. This is the cry among
no small number of those who think they have studied
the conditions of modern progress most carefully.
Widespread and plausible as are some of these views,
I desire to take fundamental issue with those who support
them.
The system of political ethics just outlined is an outgrowth
of our experience with two important institutions,
competition and representative government.
Competition has led people to see how frequently the

that the theory of struggle and compromise as a normal
means of progress needs restatement; and that the man

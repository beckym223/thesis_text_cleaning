Present Position of the Doctrine of Free Trade 47
But whether

light of specific experience. The benefits of imports
and exports, the relations of domestic and foreign in-

over-production, dumping,—these topics at once spread
over into the general field of economics. Not only do

by that mode of general reasoning from comparatively
simple premises which still remain the most valuable
tool at the disposal of the economist.

to be discovered. It has been said that, so far from
leading to improvements and eventual cheapening, it
leads to the retention of antiquated and inefficient
wages of production and so to continued enhancement
of prices. There is good ground for believing that the
long continued protective régime in France during the
first half of the nineteenth century had ill results of
this kind. One of our ardent free-traders, the late
David A. Wells, repeatedly maintained that the same
consequences had appeared in the United States. His
conclusion may have been justified by what happened
during the period of abnormal industrial conditions
that followed the Civil War; yet I doubt whether the
experience of the United States as a whole supports it.
The truth is that either result may ensue. Among

corporations. I would develop, in a word, so far as
possible the practical as well as the theoretical sides of
insurance, banking and similar departments of industry.
I find, among others, the following subjects already
offered in the curricula established in these new depart-
ments economic geography, history of commerce, busi-
ness organization and management, commercial law,
transportation, money and banking, materials of com-
merce, contracts, personal property, theory of accounts,
auditing, insurance, statistics, corporation finance.
I need not here go into any further detail; I desire
only to emphasize the fact that in my opinion any cur-
riculum for higher commercial education which does
not give reasonable attention to what might be called
the practical aspects of business life will not accom-
plish the best results.
I am not only. in favor of the universities undertaking
this function of providing higher education for business
men, but I am in favor of putting these elements into
such a shape that a young man can feel that he is fol-
lowing out a systematic course of study while pursuing
it. I believe also that the university should announce
in a definite form that it proposes to offer a curriculum
for the benefit of those men expecting to go into busi-
ness, exactly as it announces that it has a law school
or a medical school. I make this statement because
some of our universities, which have in the wide range
of their elective studies a great many of these elements
which I have mentioned, refuse to regard it as desirable
to add the other subjects which I have suggested, or
to call attention to the fact that they offer facilities which
would be worth the while of young men to take ad-
vantage of, before entering upon their active business
lives.

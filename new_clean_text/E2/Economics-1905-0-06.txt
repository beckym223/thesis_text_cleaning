trade was in the making, accepted the notion of a sur-
plus; we all know, too, how easy it was for later writers
to refute Adam Smith out of his own mouth. We are
constantly told that a tax on imports acts as a burden
on foreigners, not on the domestic consumer; though
here, as in other parts of the controversy, the proposi-
tion is more often an implied premise than an explicit
conclusion. Not least, how incessant is the blatant
assumption that all prosperity is due to the protective
system, and that disaster must ensue from any mitiga-
tion of its rigor. With some of these arguments, no
doubt a nice analysis would bring into view certain con
ditions under which a measure of plausibility, nay of
real validity, attaches to them. Thus, there are condi-
tions under which taxes on commodities are borne in
part, occasionally even in whole, by the producer and
not by the consumer. These are exceptional condi-
tions, and they are as likely to appear under internal
taxes as under customs duties. But such exceptions
and qualifications, found for every social and economic
principle by the discriminating thinker, are not among
the subjects of every-day debate. There we find the
simple fundamental principle ignored, and the baldest
of errors repeated. No doubt it is inevitable, in the
popular discussion of economic problems, that argu-
ments of the crudest sort should come to the fore. But
I confess to a sense of humiliation when our leading
statesmen turn to reasoning easy of refutation by every
youth who has had decent instruction in elementary
economics.
I do not wish to linger on these commonplaces; yet, at
the risk of being tedious, will turn for a moment to that
phase of the controversy which for near half a century.
has been most conspicuous in our country-the effect of

This argument has, however, a certain practical weight
and is heard most often, perhaps, among business men
themselves. It is, however, the same old objection which
has been raised against higher education in every de-
partment, viz. : that young men should begin with the
A, B, C, of the business or profession in practical life
rather than waste their time on theoretical courses in
college. The old-fashioned way to study medicine was
to begin by harnessing up the doctor's horse, as he pre-
pared to go his rounds, following this up by taking
medicine to the patients, and washing and cleaning the
mortars and pestles used in their preparation. The law-
yer began by copying papers, and the merchant by
sweeping out the shop; the book-binding apprentice, by
washing the dinner dishes for the housewife, etc. But
this idea has already been given up in the case of cer-
tain important callings, and must gradually disappear in
the case of many others.ยน
As to the second point, there is undoubtedly some
danger that the young men who spend from seven to
eight years in the study of Latin, Greek and mathematics,
or even in the study of French and German, and natural
science, may acquire, if not a taste for literary callings, at
least a distaste for mercantile life. But this does not prove
that the pursuit of a higher course of study, which should
be related more closely to their future work would have
the same effect. The study of the history and methods
of insurance, for example, in all their different as-
pects, need not of itself destroy all interest of young
men in the business of insurance as a practical career;
on the contrary, it would very probably increase the

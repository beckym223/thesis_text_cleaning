future lawyer, physician or engineer. In other words,
I believe it should recognize it as one of its proper and
necessary functions to provide the best facilities of which
it is capable for this training, and I am happy to say,
that in my opinion the question is no longer whether
the American university shall take this attitude, but
simply how it can recognize this function and carry it
out most efficiently and satisfactorily.
The question as to what should be the fundamental
element in the higher education and training of the future
business man, is to me comparatively simple. It should
be those branches of science which deal with the departments
of life to which business belongs. Business
is, of course, a social and economic phenomenon, and
to some extent, a political one, and consequently the
study of the political and social sciences, using that
term in a large sense, is the natural occupation of the
man who is preparing himself for a business career.
I cannot, of course, on this occasion enter into an extended
discussion of the particular branches which ought
to be included in such a curriculum, but of all the
political and social sciences, it seems to me that economics
should be accepted as the fundamental element
in any such course. It is just at this point that the interest
of this association is most intimately involved.
The science of political economy has the same relation
toward this whole department of education, as mathemathics
to the preparation of an engineer, or as physiology
or anatomy to medical training. It has, moreover,
the added advantage of being the most highly developed
of all these subjects, theoretically or practically, both as
a matter of science and as a matter of pedagogy. The
man who grapples in earnest with problems of economics
will secure, if nothing else, a mental discipline

life is the basis of social progress, but the economic
environment which conditions this life is fast becoming
an artificially created environment. In the creation of
this environment there is a continually growing sphere

the subordination of the individual to the social interest,

if he preserves his clearness of vision, his openness of
mind, his devotion to truth, and his sanity of judgment,
the deference paid to his views, which is even now beginning
to be apparent in this country, will become
more and more pronounced. The influence of economic

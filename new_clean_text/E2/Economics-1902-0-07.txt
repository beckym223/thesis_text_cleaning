government. Furthermore, the problem of liberty is
only to a minor extent a political problem. And as it
is only to a minor extent a political problem, it can
never, in any true sense, be secured by a mere repeal of
political laws, nor indeed by a mere enactment of
political laws. Neither removal of politico-economic
restrictions upon freedom of trade, nor enactment of
universal suffrage, can give us more than a small, frac-
tional part of liberty.
Our own, familiar, everyday experience teaches us that
restrictions upon our positive liberty of action are mainly
due to the coercion of economic forces. This coercion
of economic forces manifests itself in many ways, but
largely in and through contract competitively formed.
This is seen, first of all, in what may be called the prob-
lem of the twentieth man. Nineteen men wish to pur-
sue a certain course of economic action, but are coerced
competitively by the twentieth into a line of conduct
which they dislike. Nineteen barbers in the city of Mad-
ison, Wisconsin, wished to close their shops on Sunday;
the twentieth would not agree to close his, and conse-
quently, all the twenty were, and still are, kept open.
Nineteen men may desire to work ten hours a day, and
may be coerced by the twentieth into working fourteen
hours a day. Apparently they are all working fourteen
hours a day because they choose to do so, but the choice
is not a free one, in any true sense of the word. Even
the twentieth man prefers to work ten hours a day, but
yields to pressure for the sake of a temporary advantage,
and so he is likewise coerced. The freedom which thus
expresses itself in contract is in certain cases like the
freedom of a slave, who chooses to work rather than to
suffer under the lash.
The coercion of economic forces is largely due to the

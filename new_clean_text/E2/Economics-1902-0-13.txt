velopment of the police power, slow as it is, shows the
adaptability of law to changing industrial and economic
conditions. It has been said, and truly, that develop-
ment of law lags behind the evolution of industrial
society, so that the law represents a correspondence to a
preceding stage or period in industrial development. It
has been difficult for our courts to adjust themselves to
the restrictions upon nominally free contract, demanded
by the interests of a larger and truer freedom. Conse-
quently, in many cases decisions have been rendered
which must be condemned by economic philosophy.
Fortunately, however, our courts are finding the needed
element of flexibility in our constitutional system in the
police power, and are recognizing the fact that a new
economic world demands new interpretations. Under
American conditions, with upright judges of superior
intelligence, devoted to freedom as they understand it,
this proposition may be safely maintained, as has been
well stated by one of our professors of law: "It has ever
been true that in matters of great social and political
import, our legal decisions and theories have conformed
themselves to the current political and social thought,
and not our social and political thought to our legal
theories."1
Among our various state courts I think the truths.
concerning freedom, which I have so imperfectly brought
before you, have been most clearly seen and most ex-
plicitly stated by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.
Some years ago, legislation restricting the right of
women to work in a factory more than ten hours a day
and sixty hours a week was upheld. Significant ex-
tracts from the decision of the court in this case, are

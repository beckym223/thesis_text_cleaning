tradiction to our American phenomena, but which if
they were carefully analyzed, would be seen to be in almost
equal opposition to the facts of European life. We
base our theory of taxation on an explanation which
does not explain. It is high time that we should emancipate
ourselves from this foolish fetichism.
A few writers have indeed felt that there was something
wrong, but have been unable to locate the real
point of weakness. McCulloch, for instance, several
decades ago, confessed that according to the accepted
theory the income tax is ideal; but with the sound
common sense of an Englishman he sturdily maintained.
that in practice the income tax is a fraud, and he contended
that indirect taxes were therefore indispensable.
Hence his conclusion that equality of taxation cannot
be attained, and that what is right must give way to
what is expedient and practicable-truly a lamentable
conclusion. More recently Mr. Edwin Cannan stated
that "economy plays and should play a much greater
part, and equity a much smaller part, in schemes of taxation
than is commonly supposed." If this were true
we might as well abandon the notion that at bottom
there is an essential correlation between economic and
moral law, we might as well relinquish the belief, so
deeply cherished by some of us, that in the long run
the true economic welfare of a community is identical
with its abiding ethical interests.
But it is not true, and the failure to detect the truth,
the inability to perceive the real cause of the clash between
the theory and the practice is ascribable to the
fact that we have put the emphasis upon the individual,
rather than upon the social, aspect of economic law. Let
me make my meaning clear.
When we speak of the burdens of taxation, we ordin-

Present Position of the Doctrine of Free Trade 53
Consider first the case of England. Clearly several
causes contributed to the remarkable economic advance
of that country during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. Her insular position preserved her from the
wars which devastated the Continent. Her indented
coast cheapened internal transportation from an early
date. Her great mineral resources supplied the found-

of older days is supposed to have nurtured her industries
until they became independent,—with how great effect,
is the debatable question. But most important of all
has been the atmosphere of freedom and the clear ave-

were capable and strong. Political freedom came first,
and soon was supplemented by industrial freedom.
Hence the all-pervading spirit of ambition, resource,

strength has been given by the curious development of
the British social hierarchy. Nowhere has the aristoc-
racy held its place so strongly in the esteem of the rest

aristocracy been more free to the successful. The rich
merchant, manufacturer, banker, mounts readily on the
social ladder. Given plenty of riches, a little time, and

long been topics for the satirist. But materialism and
snobbishness have enlisted the strongest of social

VALUE OF MONEY
71
communities become so enormous as to carry the money
of the community with them by a species of capillary at-
traction. It is no longer, in this view, the actual money
of a country which underlies and sustains the structure of
credits: the credit structure becomes so vast and gigantic
that the money of the country depends upon it and de-
pends from it as a trivial, if not merely ornamental, ap-
pendage. Is there anything in such opinions which, how-
ever loosely held and vaguely expressed, have certainly
exerted no little influence upon recent monetary discus-
sion? Does the exaggeration of credit transactions, how-
ever monstrous they may become, in any degree release
prices from the rule which has been indicated as govern-
ing them?
Have such transactions any influence upon
the value of money other than that which has been
pointed out; namely, by accomplishing a certain cancel-
lation of indebtedness, producing the virtual result of an
extension of the field of barter and a corresponding re-
trenchment of the field for the use of money? Within
the latter field, thus diminished, does anything less or any-
thing other than the traditional principle govern the
value of money, the price of goods?
In addressing myself to this question, I desire to say,
first, that there is much of the vast volume of credit
transactions, as shown by the statistics of the bank and
the clearing house, which may, for all the purposes of the
present discussion, be termed fictitious,-fictitious in the
sense that a great part, perhaps the larger part, of these
transactions are outside the necessary work of exchange
in the community, fictitious in the sense that these trans-
actions are very largely the direct product of the exist-
ence of the agencies, the bank and the clearing house,
through which the resulting indebtedness is cancelled.
Let me illustrate my meaning. It has been stated that
the entire cotton crop of the United States is sold eight
times over in the New York market alone. I know not

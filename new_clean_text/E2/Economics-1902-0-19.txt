out that it can only mean tyranny and despotism.
Liberty cannot be an absolute ideal, because authority
is needed in society, in order to secure the harmonious
coöperation of its various elements, and without social
authority we could have no production of wealth, and
we should be without the material basis of that large and
positive liberty which enables us to employ our faculties
in the common service. This social authority rests, for
the most part, upon the great institutions of societyproperty,
vested interests, contract and personal conditions.
To only a limited extent is there a direct
political basis for the authority whereby one man brings

production. The basis of social authority is, for the
most part, institutional.
On the other hand, socialism furnishes us with no
sufficient ideal of industrial liberty. Going to the
opposite extreme from anarchy, it would find a political
basis for that social authority through which the industrial
coöperation of men is effected. It would limit the
range of free choice, and restrict liberty, although to a
less degree than anarchy. The true ideal lies midway
between anarchy and socialism, and may be termed the
principle of social solidarity. According to this
principle, the great institutions of society must be conserved,
but developed in the interests of liberty positively
conceived. There must be a carefully elaborated, and
wisely executed regulation of economic relations.
We are indulging in no Utopian fancies but are simply
describing the forces which are everywhere manifesting
themselves in the most enlightened nations, and are
resulting in an evident increase of the sphere of industrial
liberty for the masses of men. It is absurd to say
that we must not pass any law in the interests of a single
class of men, inasmuch as men exist in classes, and indus-

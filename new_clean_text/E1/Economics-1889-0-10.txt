as providing all the conditions for the most harmonious
and fortunate development of industrial society
through the spontaneous action of individuals, each
seeking his own interest, upon his own initiative.
The wide acceptance of this doctrine, thus conceived,
was greatly promoted by the fact that the economists

he should have adopted views varying from the
standard that was set up.

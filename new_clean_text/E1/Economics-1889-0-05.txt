began between the English and the German
economists themselves, aided greatly, I venture
to suggest, by the remarkable sagacity and fidelity
with which the French writers received, interpreted
and expressed the real thought of both. That movement
towards, if not the consent, at least the cöoperation
of European economists, has rapidly gone forward,
to the inexpressible advantage of political economy.
I do not mean to say that there has been such
an approach of the German and the English economists
towards each other that the two bodies have in
any sense lost their distinctive characters; nor do I
regard such a result as desirable. It is well that
there should be a national flavor to the economic
thought of each country; that national predilections,
industrial peculiarities, habits of thinking, modes of
living, should influence, and, more or less, mould its
economic investigation and speculation.

But while the German economists remain truly
German, and the English economists preserve their
individuality, each body has, in these late years,
drawn largely from the other; and in general, has
taken the best. The German economics have become
more practical and more responsible, more systematic
and more highly integrated. The English economists
have, more and more, incorporated into the premises
of their reasoning the results of biological and historical
research.

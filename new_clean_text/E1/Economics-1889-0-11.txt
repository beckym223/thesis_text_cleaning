Such intolerance was not necessarily due to bigotry.
It was, the rather, involved in the very nature of the
Laissez-Faire doctrine. If that was true, there was
no reason why an economist should have any professional
communion or intercourse with an outsider.
No good could come of it; but only a possible weakening

encouragement to heresy.
But the abandonment of Laissez-Faire, as a principle
of universal application, however strongly individuals
may still maintain it as a general rule of

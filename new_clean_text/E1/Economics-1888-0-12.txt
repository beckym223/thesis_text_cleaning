In the industrial republic, as in the political republic,
power comes to the masses accompanied by the
gravest responsibilities, and in one as in the other
the abuse or the wanton exercise of power will inflict
its worst injuries upon the humblest members of the
community. In either republic instruction as to the
duties and responsibilities of citizenship is more
needed than instruction as to the right and powers
of citizenship. Certainly during the past few years
there has been much more thought of the latter than
of the former among those who assume to promote the
interests of the laboring class; yet nothing could be
more prejudicial to those interests, when rightly
viewed, than that the impression should be created.
among the body of working men that there is anything
they can take without giving its fair and full
equivalent; that they can use the immense force
which resides in concerted action without direct and
immediate accountability for every injury which may
be inflicted thereby upon production and trade; that
they can harass employers by incessant demands,
extort undue concessions, and render it unsafe to
undertake contracts, involving large expenditures
extending over considerable periods of time, without
in the result suffering far more evil than they can
possibly inflict upon the employing or the capitalist
class. Emphatically it is true in industrial warfare,
that they who take the sword shall perish by the
sword, and those are only enemies of the working
classes who incite them to take up arms in a light
quarrel, or, in any cause, without counting well and
carefully the cost.
Such and so grave are the responsibilities which
attend all efforts of the laboring classes to improve

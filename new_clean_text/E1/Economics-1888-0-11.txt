and philanthropists yearned for it on their
account; not because the demand was enforced by
united action, carried to a point which threatened
the employers with loss or, perhaps, ruin; but it has
been for the reason that the conditions of production
and trade allowed such concessions to be made without
impairing the disposition to accumulate capital
for industrial uses, and without cutting to the quick
into the profits of business, which, under the existing
organization of industry, constitute the sole motive
to the production of wealth. Where these conditions
are met the urgent, persistent demands of the laboring
class, as well as the active sympathy of the
general community, will undoubtedly help to secure,
if, indeed, they are not essential to securing advantages
which might otherwise be withheld. Where
these conditions are not met, demands for increasing
wages or shortening the term of labor will either be
refused by the employing class, or if enforced by
united action under circumstances which compel an
immediate compliance, they will be granted, in the
given time and place, only at the cost of the general
community, and in especial of the laboring class,
first of all, last of all, and most of all.
The part which laborers are, under modern conditions,
called to perform in influencing the distribution
of the product of industry, is not a part in which
they are to do whatever is agreeable to themselves,
without careful consideration of the rights and interests
of others, and without direct responsibility for
the effects of wrongful and injudicious action. It is
just as fully true that there are no industrial rights
without corresponding duties as it is that there are
no political rights without corresponding duties.

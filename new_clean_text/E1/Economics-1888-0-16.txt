and have carried these to extremes subversive
of the general interest and even threatening the existence
of society itself, have not been men born on

found native leaders, whose superior education and
political training gave them influence over the inflamed
masses of labor; but the force and impulse of
these attacks upon social interests, and even upon
society itself, has been of foreign derivation; while

which occurred at the last-mentioned place in the
year 1885, in which nearly fifty unoffending persons
lost their lives, it was ascertained that not one man

It is not a matter of surprise, perhaps not altogether

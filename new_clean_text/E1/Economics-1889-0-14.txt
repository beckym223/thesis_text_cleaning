be turned towards the light of perfect liberty, as the
state which hath the promise of that which now is,
and, still more, of that which is to come.
Craving your pardon for this personal episode, I
will, with your indulgence, resume the story of the
great march which political economy has made in
these later days.

The first powerful influence which was given to
these studies, after the substantial completion of
formal [or abstract] political economy, through the
labors of Adam Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, and the
elder and younger Mill, came through the passionate
demands of the working classes and the social reformers,
during that period of rapid and violent fermentation
which we know as the Second French

Revolution, compelling the reopening of the question
of the distribution of wealth, which, in turn, compelled
a re-examination of the postulates of the old
political economy regarding the economic man.
For the purposes of the reasoning of Ricardo, the
elder Mill, and even the younger Mill, in his essays
on "Some Unsettled Questions," a purely artificial
being, an economic marionette, constituted simply to
exhibit the action of certain forces in production and
exchange, amply sufficed. That these figures were
highly simple bodies of a single pure substance,
without inconvenient affections and attractions,
destitute alike of sympathies, apathies and antipathies,
purely abstract and not at all of flesh and
blood, was wholly of advantage for the part they
were to perform; and no one can sufficiently admire
the masterly power and skill with which the English
reasoners of those days marshalled these puppets
and exhibited, through their evolutions, the normal
operations of production and exchange.

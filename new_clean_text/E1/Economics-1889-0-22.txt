purposes of their treatment of the distribution of
wealth, that nature itself was undergoing a profound
and pervasive change on its economic side,
I shall ask your consideration of but one other
cause which has added to the force of the economic
movement in these days; and that is the scientific
spirit now so widely spread abroad, inducing a more
careful observation of phenomena, and assisting to
a sounder interpretation of facts and statistics. Perhaps
the influence of this cause will best be shown
by an example.
In 1872, Mr. David A. Wells, one of the ablest
economic statisticians whom this country has produced,
made a report, as chairman of the Tax
Commission of the State of New York, in which
he said:
"All taxes equate and diffuse themselves; and, if
levied, with certainty and uniformity, upon tangible
property and fixed signs of property, they will, by a
diffusion and repercussion, reach and burden all
visible and also all invisible and intangible property
with unerring certainty and equality.”
Again, in 1874, Mr. Wells, in presenting to the
American Social Science Association the general
results of his work, said:
* * * *
«Taxation diffuses itself; and by laws which it is
beyond the power of man to contravene.
If they [taxes] are assessed primarily upon Mr. Astor,
he adds them to his rents; if upon Mr. Stewart, to
his goods; upon Mr. Vanderbilt, to the price of his
capital, whether sold upon the street or invested in
railways; and so, being reflected as it were to infinity
or from reflection to reflection, they eventually
become an integral part of the prices of all things.'

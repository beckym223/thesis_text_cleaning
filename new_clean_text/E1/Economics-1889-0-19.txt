nership;‚Äù not a nation in which the once despised
and downtrodden masses are not the arbiters of ministries,
the promoters of reform, the defenders, for
themselves, of their own rights and interests? Was
it a change of opinion on the part of the philosophers,
or a change of heart on the part of those who had exercised
privilege and power? Not at all. The false
opinions, in many cases, survived the constitutions in
which they had been incorporated; and no class ever,
wholly of their own choice, surrendered privilege
and power.
It was the rising of the people, repudiating
the doctrine of a guardianship over them,
rebelling against abuses, demanding their rights,
effecting reforms by just so much of threats and
force as the resistance of the ruling classes made it
necessary to use.
What was it which so recently caused the downfall
of the economic theory of the Trusteeship of
Capital: a downfall so complete that to-day any
man would be simply laughed at in a convention
of economists were he to announce the doctrine of
the economic indifference of the rate of profits, which
so able a thinker as Professor Cairnes could calmly
re-state but fifteen years ago? Has the result been
due to sounder professional thinking? Again, no.
Again, it is true that the change in opinion followed,
and followed somewhat late, upon changed conditions.
Again, it was the uprising of the classes to
whom economic reasoning had assigned the position
of wards but who, under impulses new to this age,
came forward to allege their competency to manage
their own affairs and conserve their own interests.
The working classes had "come of age," and called
their late guardians to render an account of their
stewardship.

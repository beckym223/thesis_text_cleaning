This change in economic opinion did not come all
at once. Its first manifestation was perhaps in 1864,
when Prof. Fawcett, regarding whom a distinguished
English economist wrote me, at the time of his
lamented death, that one-half of his actual intimate
daily companions were laboring men, announced at
Cambridge his conviction that, while the rate of
wages was, in ordinary times, determined altogether
irrespective of the efforts of the working classes to
secure their own interests, yet, in transitional periods,
when rapid alterations of industrial conditions were
taking place, combinations of laborers might be
effectual to win some portion of what would otherwise.

as previously stated, it is fully recognized that the
self-assertion of the laboring class importantly contributes
to the equitable and beneficial distribution
of wealth; and that such self-assertion, within
proper limits and by proper agencies, is not more for
the interest of the laboring class than of the employing

Inasmuch as so short a period has elapsed since
there was a general consent of economic opinion that

Even were scholars only concerned, it would necessarily
take much time to educe the full philosophy of
such a subject; to give to powerful agencies, so

wide divergency of views on many points! We are
all laborers together, engaged upon a task of limitless
consequence to our kind. The blunders, the
misconceptions of any truthful man will hinder the
progress of the work less than his honest, hearty
interest in the work will help it on. The blunders,
the misconceptions will be corrected by others, never

In whatever has been said regarding the doctrine of
Laissez-Faire, I desire not to be misunderstood. I am,
with all my heart, a believer in the virtue of freedom,

rule to which exception should be made only upon
clear grounds of urgent public interest. I believe
that a heavy burden of proof rests upon every proposal
to limit or hamper the free action of individuals.

of men's hearts and the blindness of men's eyes;
that law should be ever a schoolmaster, leading us
to a larger capacity for self-government and selfdirection;
that the face of mankind should steadily

Several of the most important governmental activities in
the United States to-day, although industrial in nature,
are of this type, especially those which relate to the
development and conservation of our national resources.
Foremost in the public eye is the Panama Canal; but of
scarcely less importance are the noble plans of the present
administration for the development of our great inland
water-ways, the bringing under cultivation through irri-

useless, the reclamation of swamps and bayous through
the building of levees and drainage ditches, and the
rapidly developing movement for the conservation and
eventually the profitable cultivation of our forests. All
these enterprises are of such a nature that, although they
are fundamentally industrial and ultimately enormously
profitable, the government, to protect the interests of
coming generations, must exercise immediate control and
in most cases must carry on the industry as a government
enterprise. Most of these colossal undertakings, however,
are of such a nature that the larger part of the direct
work can be done, if necessary, through the aid of private
corporations, the government retaining ownership and
exercising control in the careful inspection and super-
vision of contracts.

may be managed by the government with least waste. In

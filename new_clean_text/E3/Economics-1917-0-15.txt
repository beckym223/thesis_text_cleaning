Can
forms of government, tribes and nations of men as well.
democracy discipline itself and fit itself to meet this test? If not,
democracy can no more survive than could any of the other thou-
sand and one organisms that have become extinct through their
inability to meet the conditions. The world has always been ruled
by the disciplined nations, and unless there is a complete reversal
of the process, it will be ruled by them to the end of time. If
democrats can discipline themselves as well as rulers can discipline
their subjects, then democracy may survive; otherwise not.
There is no motive known to any student which will compel a
whole democracy to discipline itself, except a powerful national
sentiment. The individuals must all, with one accord, care and
care intensely for the same thing. This and this alone will enable
each person to subject his interests to the good of the whole, and
the lesser interest of the present to the larger interest of the
future. Only they to whom Webster's words on Union and Liberty
meant something for which they cared considerably were prepared
to hazard their lives for that something. Only they who, like
Milton, see in their minds "a great and puissant nation," have
the vision which keeps men from becoming demoralized, from
throwing off restraint, from becoming undisciplined. Without
this endurance of restraint-without this self-discipline-the peo-
ple perish.

CITIZENS MUST RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF
GOVERNMENT.
Too little emphasis is often laid upon the import-
ance of having fixed in the minds of the citizens of every
country the fundamental principle that the only way in
which citizens can act politically on any social question is
through the government. There exists of course the so-
called right of revolution, but this may be ignored as
foolishly impracticable in this connection. In all coun-
tries, though most easily in a democracy, the will of the
citizens may comparatively easily be brought to expression
if people are thoughtful and active, and not one proposed
reform in a thousand is important enough in its effect
upon the welfare of the citizens to justify any setting.
aside of the authority of government for its accomplish-
ment. People sometimes foolishly, on account of the
slowness of governmental action or the corruption of a
few government officials, apparently despair of the suc-
cess of popular government. How many times within
the last ten years we have heard wild talk about the
ownership of our government by the moneyed classes,
and of the impossibility of having a wealthy malefactor
brought to justice. Some of our late governmental ac-
tions, such as the judicial decision in the Northern Se-
curities case, the investigation of the insurance companies
in New York, and the exposure of the Trusts by the
Bureau of Corporations, have been chiefly valuable, not
for their immediate results, but for showing the public
clearly and conclusively the very simple but all important
truth that government can and does rule. How far then
the government of any state shall control business and
business men and in what manner, is a matter within the
determination of the government itself, keeping always
the welfare of the citizens in view.

map many cities swarming like ant hills, the delight of the real
estate speculator and the despair of true friends of humanity.

suburbs, away from fields, and forests, and mountains; or shall we
not rather give to all our people space to earn an ample living and
to live an ample life, worthy of our democratic ideal?

Government Control of Business

ner and in the degree that the officials for the time being
think best. The only legal right that the citizens have,
so far as government activity goes, is that of having
their will carried out through their officials.
IMPRACTICABILITY OF THEORY OF NATURAL RIGHTS.
3. Large numbers of our people find a basis for argu-
ment and apparently much personal comfort in a discus-
sion of their "natural rights", as if they had rights.
opposed to the legal rights given them by the state. Such
an expression is, of course, an excellent talking point as
a basis for argument to convince people, and perhaps
through them to change the opinion of the government as
to what ought to be done. But, as an immediate principle
to direct governmental action, the theory of natural rights,
as interpreted by the individual beyond what is laid
down in law, is a vagary of enthusiasts, a breeder of fa-
natacism; and it is harmful, because it turns aside from
practical means the minds of many of our most unselfish,
high-minded, public-spirited citizens. The only sound
basis for advocating a change in governmental policies
is that the welfare of society will be improved by the
change advocated. Let all arguments for social reform
be made on this basis; let the weight of argument show
the practicability of securing the desired benefit; convert
thereby as many of the citizens as possible; thus you
may convert the government. The whole question of
governmental activity in business matters is not one of
the "natural right" of an individual as against his govern-
ment or against his fellow citizens; it is one of the
thoughtful judgment of the few men who are directing
the affairs of political society as to the practicable means
for doing their duty under the powers laid down in the
constitution and laws.

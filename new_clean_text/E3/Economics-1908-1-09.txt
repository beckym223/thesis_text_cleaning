easier and more necessary, while a people that is alert,
ambitious, and used to self-direction, will, in general,
prefer to do its own work and can successfully do it.
BY NATURE OF INDUSTRIES CONCERNED.
NECTED WITH GOVERNMENT.
THOSE CON-
e. 1. The character of the industry, too, affects strongly
the extent and nature of governmental control over it.
Certain industries are so closely associated with the gov-
ernment that is it practically essential that the government
manage them. The necessity of careful and rapid trans-
mission of intelligence on government business led gov-
ernments, even in ancient times, to establish post roads
and relays of messengers by whom orders could be sent
from the central government to outlying provinces.
Gradually out of this necessity of government has grown
our post-office system which seems now to exist primarily
for the conduct of private business; but if, as at times
has been suggested, the post-office business were to be
put into private hands, the government would still need to
exercise control so rigid that its own messages would
certainly be carried promptly and secretly. For similar
reasons governments as a rule erect their own forts,
maintain their own arsenals, and usually build their own
warships. Entirely aside from the question of relative
cost, most governments will prefer to build their own
war-ships; and even where this is not done in their own
yards, the government control must be absolute.
THOSE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE.
e. 2. Even some industries that are not practically a
part of the government's business, may yet be of so
fundamental concern to practically all citizens that it
would be considered dangerous to leave them in private

to a greater degree than elsewhere, while our legal system of
checks and balances prevents the government from holding such
interests in check.
With our concentrated wealth and large-scale production, in
the absence of a wise and conscious social policy, increased popu-
lation and consequent rise in rents will tend to shut out an ever-
increasing part of the population from dominion over or ownership
in the natural resources and implements and tools of production.
The vague phrases, fortunately heard less frequently than
formerly, about the rich becoming richer and the poor poorer,
whether true or not, have no bearing on this point. Experience
has demonstrated that the whole system of individualism and indi-
vidual bargaining places the weaker members of society, when left
to their own individual devices, in such a position as to prevent not
only their improving their economic status but even their maintain-
ing their present position. Furthermore, the degree to which con-
centrated control of wealth has already gone tends to make the
parties more and more unequal in bargaining power. Hence it
becomes easier and easier for the concentrated wealth to increase
the distance between the two classes, while the ability of individuals
to pass from one class to another grows constantly less. The ten-
dency of all natural forces, under present conditions, is to crystal-
lize and intensify class distinctions.
The present form of organization drives more and more women
and children into industry, the proportion of women gainfully
employed to the whole number of persons so employed having
increased from 13 per cent in 1870 to 21.2 per cent in 1910,
while recent figures from the stock yards district of Chicago show
that out of 194 families, in 94 of which the father is the sole wage
earner, the fathers earn but 54.4 per cent of the total income.* At
the same time that this influx of women and children into industry
is taking place, real, as distinct from money wages, have constantly
declined since 1906.5
The picture that I have drawn is not a pessimistic one. In the
spirit of the earlier economists, I have merely tried to point out
certain tendencies, and to show that if these tendencies were al-
lowed to work unimpeded certain results, not pleasant to contem-

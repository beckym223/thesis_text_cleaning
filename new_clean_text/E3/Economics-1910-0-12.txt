present time. The error of Henry George, socialists, or
extreme individualists is not so much in their reasoning
as in defective observation. Too many of them cannot
distinguish between puff-balls and apples.
At the present time we are interested in currency re-
form, an interest largely stimulated by certain phenomena
witnessed in 1907. For a satisfactory discussion of this
question there are three elements to be considered: first,
the phenomena of 1907, that is, the facts of the panic;
second, the causes; and, third, the remedies. The first is
a matter of observation, the others involve our reasoning
faculty. Do we know the fundamental and elementary
facts which are associated with this panic? One observer
notes that the Hepburn Act was followed by a loss of con-
fidence; another that it was succeeded by enthusiastic
confidence and unbridled speculation; one observes that
the phenomena of the panic were local, another that they
were international, extending over four continents; one
observes that the currency was inelastic, another that not
for many years had there been so much expansion; one
observes that an excessive amount of wealth had been di-
verted to enterprises which were not immediately pro-
ductive; another that the amount was not relatively
large; one observes that Wall Street speculation was at a
comparatively low level in the two years preceding Octo-
ber, 1907; another that stock exchange operations were
exceedingly violent; one observes that the panic was the
severest within the memory of man, another that it was
not so disastrous as those of 1893 and 1873.
Now these are questions of fact; and until these dif-
ferences are reconciled and agreement as to what really.
happened is attained, how can we profitably busy our-
selves with judgment as to causes or remedies? If we
spent as much time in dissecting the panic of 1907 and

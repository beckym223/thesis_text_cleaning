mass, chapter-deep, culled at random both as to time
and as to territory, do not fit into a system of reasoning
so as to make a lasting impression. As a result the stu-
dent leaves the subject with but a hazy notion of the
science as a whole; and, what is worse, has not made an
adequate gain in mental power through the training of
his faculties in abstract reasoning.
For my part, notwithstanding my interest in the de-
scriptive characteristics of the economic life, I am often
drawn to the conclusion that for the sake of the student
it would be better to accept economics as a deductive
science pure and simple, and treat it as a series of rigor-
ous exercises in abstract reasoning, rather than to per-
petuate the disconnected, mixed, and incongruous
method which so many text-books impose upon us today.
The doubt is prompted because we find so much apparent
variation in the abstract reasoning. It may be that this
is an unfair judgment, and that there is a larger content
of accepted reasoning that I have implied; but, if this
is true, the language of exposition and the terminology
employed have so disguised the familiar concept that it
appears to be a stranger.
We may hope, however, that progress will be made
toward agreement even within a limited field. When
this is accomplished, and there is a sufficient amount
of material presented in a form which can be safely
turned over to the student, from which he can with con-
fidence gain a knowledge of the fundamental principles
and their application as derived by logical processes
when this is done, our problem will be greatly simplified,
for the writer or the teacher will no longer be harrassed
by the feeling that in some way he must make good the
uncertainties of his reasoning by thrusting into his expo-
sition a certain amount of useful knowledge relating to

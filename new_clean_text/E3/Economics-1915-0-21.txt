opinion, representing, at any time, a clear majority of the
community.

It would seem to require no demonstration that a state politically,
or an economic organization within a state, cannot be considered
in stable equilibrium, or likely to endure unchanged, when
under a wide suffrage and extended political rights the majority of
the people want that system changed.

But this is not a disturbing thought. It means evolution, not
revolution; not abolition of private property, but the bringing
of the rights of private property into harmony with the
desires and needs of the age. No sudden or violent change or
destruction is needed, but a gradual, orderly, and peaceful modification
and adaptation of institutions, and consequently of economics,
to a modern, changed environment and to public welfare.

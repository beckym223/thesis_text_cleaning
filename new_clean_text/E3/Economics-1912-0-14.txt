more and more critical. The business world is applying rigorous
tests to ascertain results. The educational world is studying
methods of efficiency. The economist will be liable to go through
another period of discredit, unless he realizes that he must apply
to his study the patience, the exactitude, the devotion to truth by
which the great conquests of natural science have been obtained.
He needs all of these qualities in a larger degree even than the
student of nature, because of the long period through which his
observations have to extend, and the great complexity of the
phenomena with which he is dealing. But if he can apply these
qualities in the realization that the world of economic change is
his laboratory, and that it is his task to interpret its lessons, he
will have his reward, in helping to solve the great human problems
which have vexed mankind since the dawn of history.

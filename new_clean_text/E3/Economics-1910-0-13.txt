noting what really happened in the twelve-month previ-
ous as we do in devising ingenious machinery for estab-
lishing a new currency system, we might perhaps move
more slowly; but later we should at least have the assur-
ance of knowing what we wish to accomplish.
The complexity of our phenomena appears to defy ac-
curate observation. There are so many variables that it is
difficult to separate the mass into its component parts.
The economist is asked: Is the present increased produc-
tion of gold responsible for the advance in prices? and
replies: I do not know; there are so many forces at work
which might affect prices, I cannot be sure which is the
determining cause. A braver answer, and I believe a
more accurate explanation of ignorance would be to at-
tribute it to inadequate observation. If our knowledge of
past experience was enlarged, and every known instance
of increased prices was observed with simultaneous ob-
servations of demand for commodities; of restricted sup-
ply; of the nature of the commodity which was priced;
of the cost of production, and the volume of money; a
part at least of the error might be eliminated by adopting
the well known rules of logic which other sciences em-
ploy, as the differential method, method of avoidance,
method of compensation, and so on. Great honor is due
to Mr. David A. Wells for attempting single-handed the
solution of this problem by one of the methods indi-
cated, and the example of his analysis ought to inspire
others to a similar task. As Mill says, "The order of
nature as perceived at a first glance presents a chaos fol-
lowed by another chaos." But Mill is not dismayed. He
continues, â€œWe must decompose each chaos into single
facts. We must learn to see in the chaotic antecedent a
multitude of distinct antecedents, in the chaotic conse-
quent a multitude of distinct consequents."1 Nor am I

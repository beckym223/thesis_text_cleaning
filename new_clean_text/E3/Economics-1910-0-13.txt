noting what really happened in the twelve-month previous
as we do in devising ingenious machinery for establishing
a new currency system, we might perhaps move
more slowly; but later we should at least have the assurance
of knowing what we wish to accomplish.

The complexity of our phenomena appears to defy accurate
observation. There are so many variables that it is
difficult to separate the mass into its component parts.
The economist is asked: Is the present increased production
of gold responsible for the advance in prices? and
replies: I do not know; there are so many forces at work
which might affect prices, I cannot be sure which is the
determining cause. A braver answer, and I believe a
more accurate explanation of ignorance would be to attribute
it to inadequate observation. If our knowledge of
past experience was enlarged, and every known instance
of increased prices was observed with simultaneous observations
of demand for commodities; of restricted supply;
of the nature of the commodity which was priced;
of the cost of production, and the volume of money; a
part at least of the error might be eliminated by adopting
the well known rules of logic which other sciences employ,
as the differential method, method of avoidance,
method of compensation, and so on. Great honor is due
to Mr. David A. Wells for attempting single-handed the
solution of this problem by one of the methods indicated,
and the example of his analysis ought to inspire
others to a similar task. As Mill says, "The order of
nature as perceived at a first glance presents a chaos followed
by another chaos." But Mill is not dismayed. He
continues, â€œWe must decompose each chaos into single
facts. We must learn to see in the chaotic antecedent a
multitude of distinct antecedents, in the chaotic consequent
a multitude of distinct consequents."1 Nor am I

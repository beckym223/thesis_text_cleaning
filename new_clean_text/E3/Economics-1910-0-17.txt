to direct the administration of statistical affairs.
In many departments desirable reforms have been effected,
and yet too often somewhere in the administration
of these offices there is a cog missing which makes the
results unsatisfactory. Experts at the top may secure better
methods of interpretation, but they alone cannot secure
correct and accurate observation of the primary data
which are to be interpreted. Attention must be given to
the competency of the field workers, the factory operatives,
in order to justify the laborious inferences of the
experts who use the raw material.

Nor would I appear to slight the intensive and descriptive
studies of those who have made noteworthy contributions
to economic theory. Many of these have observed
to good purpose, as in transportation, taxation, agriculture,
and human vitality. Such activity proves that we
are fortunately supplied with competent directors. It
only remains to organize this potential force so that it
will mark out and conduct an intelligent program whereby
the nation can learn to know itself.

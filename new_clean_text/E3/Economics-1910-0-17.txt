In many departments desirable reforms have been ef-

of these offices there is a cog missing which makes the
results unsatisfactory. Experts at the top may secure bet-
ter methods of interpretation, but they alone cannot se-
cure correct and accurate observation of the primary data

experts who use the raw material.
Nor would I appear to slight the intensive and descrip-

ture, and human vitality. Such activity proves that we
are fortunately supplied with competent directors. It
only remains to organize this potential force so that it
will mark out and conduct an intelligent program whereby
the nation can learn to know itself.

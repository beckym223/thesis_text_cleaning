I am not advocating a so-called weak foreign policy:
quite the contrary. To be just and honest and truthful, a
ruler need not be blind to the faults of others nor afraid to
stand for the rights of his people. Indeed, he must de-
mand right as well as do right. But he must look to
ultimate good in the highest moral welfare of his people
and not merely to the glitter of the business profit of to-
day. The reputation for honesty and truthfulness, too,
will give any statesman a decided advantage in negotia-
tion. Consider the reputation and success of Secretary
John Hay in his later years. As in the case of private
business, the greatest reward should come for the greatest
service, so, as each country in peace contributes to the
welfare of others, it will receive-as it should receive-
the returns that will be most beneficial.
It is easy to see that the public moral sentiment of the
world is already aroused. And we have every reason to
believe that in the sphere of politics, as well as in that of
business, we shall see an ever-accelerating progress. In
the future, our great business men will not be able to
shelter themselves behind the defense of the statesman,
and claim that the “higher good" impels them to do deeds
that are evil in private life. The issue ultimately depends
upon us. We, the individuals who compose the state,
must shoulder the responsibility. If we make felt, thru
the state and thru public sentiment, our determination to
do right and justice in national affairs and in private
business, and define right and justice in terms of service,
not of selfishness, neither statesmen nor business men will
refuse to yield. It is right for us to find fault with our
politicians and our business men. They have deserved
it; but we should also find fault with ourselves. Their
crimes and cruelties are no more ignoble than are our
petty deceits and meannesses, our selfishness and conceal-

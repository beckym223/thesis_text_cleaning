inertia, which prevents us at times from seeing the meaning
of social conditions, has, to be sure, a conservative
power that is often beneficial; but it has also its evil side,
and it affords a partial explanation of many acts which
we are inclined to condemn as wrong. This is a social
fact never to be ignored. How does it fit our problem?
What are the new conditions of business which may
affect our standards of honor? Four characteristics of
modern business have an important bearing upon this
problem:

1) Business is done on a vastly larger scale than ever
before.

2) The modern business man does not come into personal
contact with his workingmen, his customers, or the
consumers of his products, as did his predecessor of half
a century ago.

3) The directors and officers of our great corporations
are now trustees for thousands of stockholders;
earlier the corporations did not exist, and there was no
such trusteeship.

4) Large profits from monopolies that are legal,
but sometimes economically and socially unjustifiable,
are more frequent now than earlier.

These facts demand thoughtful consideration. When
two or three grocers or butchers in a country village formally,
or informally, agree to maintain prices, the transaction
is not materially different in nature from that of an
agreement between different members of a beef-trust, or
from the so-called “gentlemen's agreement” to maintain
rates on our railways. But, in the first instance, while
a few customers have their private opinions about the
meanness of their neighbors and fellow-church-members,
no one feels that a serious wrong has been committed,
altho in that locality a monopoly has been produced;

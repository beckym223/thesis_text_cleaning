in order to deal intelligently with the currency problem.
But aside from omissions, there is the confusion in the
facts which are now available. Well may we long with
Professor Clark for the "discovery of facts which mean
something and are capable of orderly arrangements and
interpretation." Otherwise, as he says, "there is danger
of collecting a mass of information so vast and chaotic
that it will be useful chiefly as a means of moral discipline
for the baffled student."

For the present difficulties it seems to me that we are
largely to blame. In devoting attention so exclusively
to "determining what are likely to be the immediate and
ultimate effects of various groups and causes‚Äù, economists
have lost sight of a certain share of their elementary
responsibilities, and because of this the science suffers.
It is not to be inferred, however, that economists
have shirked intentionally. I believe they appreciate the
need of observation and exact data, and that never were
they so far as their reasoning goes - more free from
dogmatizing than at the present time; but in the more
absorbing interest of abstract processes, they have quite
naturally failed to become acquainted with the methods.

Consider the recent systematic text-books on political
ecomony. The method of exposition is largely through abstract
reasoning; some of them, indeed, may fairly be
termed treatises in applied psychology. And here again, I
have no complaint to offer. It is probably the best method
of presenting the subject as a scientific body of knowledge,
but this method does not necessarily involve the use of
facts except in most general terms. The ordinary reader
does not realize that these general affirmations are based

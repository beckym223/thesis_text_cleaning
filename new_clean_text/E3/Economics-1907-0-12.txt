public. Our eyes now are open; but how many of us
two years ago would have seen clearly if we had been
given the same problem to solve?
The temptation has been more subtle, too, from the
fact that in very many instances fortunes have been made
thru the legal right to enjoy an unearned increment of
profit, whether of rent or monopoly, which tho legally
justified has been economically and socially unjustifiable.
Do not misunderstand me. Tho I find fault with some
of our laws, I am not denouncing our present organiza-
tion of society, nor talking about any "natural right,‚Äù
nor advocating any sweeping revolutionary measure of
reform. Genuine reforms cannot come that way. Few
customs are altogether wrong. Social wrongs are sel-

changed. And few business or political principles are
universally applicable. Let us note some examples.
Probably no saner or wiser or juster policy on the
whole was ever adopted by any people than that by which
our country under our homestead laws gave to our fron-
tier settlers the unearned increment of rent of land-the
policy which has made our central west the granary of
nations, its people perhaps the most prosperous of the
world. But this striking example does not argue that
land-rent should always under all circumstances go un-
touched to a private owner; nor that land laws which
work injustice should not be changed. I am not dis-

like gas plants and street-railroads may often be wise and
just, it is still on the other hand clear that very many of
our gifts of franchise of monopolies and many of our
laws which have encouraged monopoly, while constitu-

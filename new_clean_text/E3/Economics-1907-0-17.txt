to give the largest profit, however large it might be,
to the competitor to whom it is rightly due, because he
has earned it by service. We should not join in the denunciation
of the wealthy simply because they are

wealthy, nor on the other hand object to fair wages because
they are fairly high. We should denounce only
the unjust. It would then be much easier than it is now
to exclude cheating, misrepresentation, adulteration.
Third, The beneficial result of honesty, good laws and
good service can best be secured by publicity. This must
be attained in part by the sanction of the state, in part by
the education of public sentiment. The chief reason
why, under present circumstances, it is necessary to have
business secrets is that the buying public is not willing to
give the higher profit to the man who renders the better
social service and carries on his business with a view to
the real interests of his workmen and of the public. We
assume, generally speaking, that the manufacturer is
asking too high a price, and we are all of us looking for
bargains. When we are willing to pay adequately for
actual service rendered, men can much more easily do
business under the public eye.

No one realizes better than I do how difficult it will
be to bring about this result. And yet it is certain that
we have already in our society taken many steps in this
direction, and that part of the present outcry against the
abuses of corporations has come just because the public
is so much better trained in this direction, and because we
are more sensitive to justice now than ever before.
Even when these things are done, we may scarcely expect
that there is to be an immediate revolution in moral
ideals or in business practice. We may not hope that by
exposures of corruption, however flagrant, public sentiment
can be quickly changed; that, by act of legislature,

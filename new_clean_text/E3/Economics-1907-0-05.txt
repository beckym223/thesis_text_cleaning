fit of one individual or of a small group of individuals,
involves the wealth or ruin of rival establishments em-
ploying thousands of laborers, the discrimination be-
comes a public danger. The driver of a stage-
coach may if he will, give a
lift to a weary trav-
eler or to a personal friend.
When the local mag-
nate whose freight is half of
all the freight hauled
by the coach asks a favor, it will be granted; and few
people are harmed thereby. When, however, a railroad
corporation, bullied by threats of injury to business,
grants a favor to a great manufacturer, this favor may
mean a monopoly that will take millions from the people.
(We may properly note as a fact that rebates by railroad
companies or special favors by the manager of a great
corporation have, relatively speaking, been very rarely
given to personal friends for personal reasons, tho per-
sonal favors were common in the small transactions of
an earlier generation; but rebates have often been ex-
torted by great establishments, and often freely granted
by railroads to secure large shipments.) But in any
event, while we should all approve the generous action of
the stage-driver, we all, rightly, condemn the railroad.
The railroad is a common carrier, a creature of the public.
It is, however, easy to see that a business man, whether
cordial and kindly or eager and grasping, when working
for the extension of his trade, may not take time to fol-
low thru all their intricacies, the manifold baleful effects
of his acts of discrimination. He sees his own benefit;
he overlooks the public injury.
And this principle is everywhere active. It is alive
in our human nature. The removal from personal con-
tact with their laborers, with their customers, and with
the consumers of their products, takes from business men
the sense of the cruelty and meanness which their acts

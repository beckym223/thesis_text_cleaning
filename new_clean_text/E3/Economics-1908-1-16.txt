industry. Even, therefore, where it seems best to aban-
don the idea of direct public management of industry,
it is well within the power of the government and may
much more frequently be found advisable to adopt a
system of rigid public control.
EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL MANAGEMENT UPON THE
PEOPLE.
9. Of vastly more importance than the immediate
ecomonic result, whether good or ill, of the government
management of industry, are the indirect effects upon
the temper and intelligence and development of the peo-
ple. The effects of government activity in industry are
some of them good, some bad. It is desirable to discrim-
inate carefully, and in determining a government's policy
to perform so far as possible only acts that will have a
good effect upon the people.
IT MAY SET AN EXAMPLE TO PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS.
As has already been explained, the government activity
in behalf of the general welfare can at times be carried
out on lines impossible for a private company. It is pos-
sible for the government, if necessary, to support an
industry in part by taxation, as, in order to increase the
general intelligence, we in part support our post-office.
For the same end the Government may in certain lines
make experiments, industrial as well as political. With
careful regard for cost of work and justice to the tax-
payer the Government in its industrial enterprises should
lead and educate public opinion in promoting the welfare
of society. In all government enterprises, a standard of
excellence should be set in the quality of work done, in
the conditions of work of the laborers, in strictness of
accounting, in upright management.

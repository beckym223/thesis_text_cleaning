Massachusetts held a leading position. If there are eleven states,
one of 10,000,000 and ten of 1,000,000, and all remainders are rejected,
the chances are that the ten remainders of the small states
will in combination be several times as great as the one remainder
in the large state. Or in the case of Massachusetts in 1832, with
a ratio of one representative to 47,000 people and 12 representatives,
the apportionment against which Everett and Webster protested,
that state would have had, to be sure, only 197 representatives
to 10,000,000 people, far short of the standard 213; but the
smallest five states then in the Union, which together had a population
somewhat less than that of Massachusetts, would have received
only 172 representatives per 10,000,000 people. Massachusetts
would have fallen 16 below the standard, but they would
have fallen 25 below Massachusetts. Massachusetts would have
had a rejected fraction of .99 but they would have had rejected
fractions amounting in combination to 2.38.
To test the conclusion that the method of rejected fractions
favors the populous states I have reapportioned the House for
every decade between 1790 and 1840 by applying the method of
apportionment employed in 1910 to the conditions and compared
the results with those actually embodied in the laws. The states
which were given too many representatives between 1790 and 1840
include New York and Massachusetts, each of which received four
more than it deserved, Pennsylvania, which received three more, and
Virginia, which received two more. Among the smaller states
Delaware should have had four more than it had, Vermont three
more, New Jersey two more, Connecticut, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Missouri one more. Thus, during the first five decades of
apportionment, the populous states as a group got thirteen representatives
more than they were entitled to and the small states,
as a group, thirteen less. The efforts of Everett and Webster,
called forth by what looked like a serious injustice to Massachusetts,
led to the introduction ten years later of a better method,
but in so doing overturned a method by which in the long run
Massachusetts had profited as much as any state in the Union.
I conclude that the method of apportionment used between
1790 and 1830, under which all fractional remainders were rejected,
is incorrect and unconstitutional and that for two reasons:
first, it does not apportion in each state as near as may be to the
standard and, secondly, it regularly results in over-representing
the populous states.

States today because of the terrific strain to which our institutions
and our life are being subjected by the enormous immigration into
our body politic and body social from nearly every land under the
sun.
We do not yet know very much about the effect of the mixture
of nationalities upon national progress. We do not even know
enough about the laws of biology to determine whether the outcome
of such a mixture will be good or bad; but one thing I think we can
be perfectly sure of, and that is that the inpouring of these
enormous masses of people of such varying intellectual standards;
of such varying ideals, political, social, and religious; of such
physical differences-must threaten in the most marked way the
ideals and practices and institutions of this great republic. The
ultimate outcome may be good, for I am one of those who recognize
very distinctly that the ideals of some of these immigrants are in
certain directions higher than our own; that they are bringing
to us qualities in which we are defective; and I have great hope
that, in the long run, great good will come out of this accession
to our ranks. But in the meantime everything threatens to be-
come more or less unstable. It becomes more difficult to forecast
what is going to happen under a given set of conditions; and in
all this development a comprehensive system of national education
is needed, a system which will take hold of everyone of these
foreigners and of his children and work them over and digest
them, so to speak, make American citizens of them, enable them to
comprehend our history and our ideals, help them to appreciate
our standards, and, if theirs are higher than ours, help them to
make these effective. In all this work nothing is for an instant to
be compared in effectiveness to such an educational system as I
have been outlining, a system which will actually take hold of
every child; will give him the elements of a common education, and
will train him for efficiency in American life and industry.
Friends, we are very prone to brag on our educational system
and our great facilities, but it does not do for us to close our
eyes to certain plain and simple facts; and on such an occasion
as this we ought to consider them with care. The fact is that
no civilized nation has within its midst any population of equal
numbers so sunk in ignorance, so beyond the reach of modern
educational influences, as the negro population of the United
States, particularly in those sections where, owing to their num-
bers, they practically become a dominating element,-not dom-

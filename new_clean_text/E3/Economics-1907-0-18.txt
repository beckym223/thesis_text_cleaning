reforms can be quickly brought about; or that by the mere
election of an honest, clean-minded Governor or President,
honesty and honor will at once permeate the public
service and change the tenor of private business. But
we do know that already something has been accomplished
in all these directions, and we think, that by a careful
analysis of the conditions and a steadfast effort on
the part of the thinkers of society, a higher standard of
honor in business as well as in politics can probably be
steadily and surely, tho slowly, approached.
But we must not overlook the political problem: If our
assumption has been true that the apparent lowering of
the standard of business honor in late years has been due
in some degree to the normal shifting of the attitude of
the manager of a great corporation, who feels himself a
trustee for his stockholders, to the attitude of the ruler of
a state, we need, before our study is complete, to judge
the ethical standard of the political ruler. While from
the days of Machiavelli, and, later, of the anti-Machiavel
rulers, students of political science have, with perhaps
equal conscientiousness, differed on the question of the
attitude of rulers in the appreciation of moral principles to
public questions, no one who has observed the trend of
modern history can doubt that both the weight of public
opinion and the practice of governments are steadily uplifting
the ethical standards of rulers toward the ethical
standards of private persons, as idealised in the precepts
and life of the Founder of Christianity. When we realize
that all of us, even in this advanced age, are controlled by
custom in dress, social entertainment, business, politics,
religion; that in many communities the man who eats
with his knife is far more certainly ostracized than the
guilty party in a divorce suit, or the man who gains
wealth by wrecking railroads on the stock exchange, we

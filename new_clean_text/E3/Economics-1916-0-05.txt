it follows that a method giving the populous states
systematically either more members or fewer members per unit of
population than the small states is incorrect.
We have, then, two criteria, of a just and constitutional apportionment:
first, the ratio in each state must be as near as may be
to the standard ratio; and, secondly, the method must hold the
scales even between the large and the small states.
The ratio either for the country or for a state is usually expressed
as the average number of persons to one representative.
For example, under the apportionment law of 1911 there were
211,877 persons to a representative. But for my purposes it is
better to conceive that each inhabitant of the country or of a state
has an equal interest in a representative and to express that interest
in the form of a decimal, such as .000005 or .0000047 or
.00000472. A further improvement gets rid of the long decimals
by taking a round number of people, say 10,000,000, as a unit
and computing the number of representatives to that unit. When
ratios are stated in this form, the meaning is more quickly grasped
through ear or eye and comparisons between two ratios are more
easily made.

Armed with these criteria of a correct apportionment, we are
in a position to approach the problem. Because of the historical
interest attaching to it I will first apply the tests to the apportionment
of 1832, the last made under the method of rejected fractions.
The ratio used in the bill before the House was one representative
to 47,000 people, which is equal to 213 representatives
to 10,000,000. Under this ratio Massachusetts was entitled to
12.99 representatives and the question before Congress was, Should
it receive 12 or 13? If it received only 12 representatives, it
would be at the rate of 197 to 10,000,000 people; if 13, it would
be at the rate of 213 to 10,000,000 people, the standard ratio.
Tried by Webster's test of nearness, then, Massachusetts was
entitled to 13 representatives and was defrauded by receiving only
12. It is not surprising that Edward Everett in the House and
Daniel Webster in the Senate joined in a vigorous, though in its
momentary effect an unsuccessful, onslaught upon a method which
led to such results.

They did not notice, however, and since that controversy ended,
no one, I believe, has remarked, that the system of rejecting all
fractions, even those as large as .99, confers an unjust advantage
in the long run upon the populous states, among which at the time

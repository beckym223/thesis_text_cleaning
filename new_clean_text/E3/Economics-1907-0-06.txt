would sometime be seen to have, if the consequences
were immediate and personal. Nearness, personal touch,
is an active force. Many a ruler has signed the death-
warrant of a criminal whom he has never seen, an account
of whose guilt he has been willing to take from others
with little investigation, when he would have hesitated

changes. Our courts declare the law, it is true, but in
declaring the law, they must keep in mind the fact that
the intention of prime importance in the minds of our
forefathers was the welfare of the people throughout the
coming generations; and they will not rigidly insist upon
an unchanging application of old words to new condi-
tions. The Courts will of course be slow and careful
in their adaptations of laws to new conditions, but even-
tually the conditions will force the reasonable interpre-
tation. Some people are of the opinion that our Courts
of last resort would be strengthened in this kind of work
if one or two members were men trained primarily not in
law but in the principles of business. The suggestion is
worth careful consideration. In the discussion of such
questions as these just asked, therefore, the point chiefly
to be kept in mind is this: Are the local and state gov-
ernments so organized that they can meet the new eco-
nomic conditions? We need not now inquire what specific
conditions the founders of our government had in mind
when they wrote the Constitution, with the added thought,
perhaps, that we must, so far as possible, attempt to hold
ourselves back to the conditions of a century ago. With
present conditions in mind, federal control of interstate

Heretofore our business standard has really been: "the
greatest possible reward for self in return for the least
service." When we once see ourselves clearly in our
social relations, in business and in politics, we shall see
that the fitter standard is: "the greatest service possible
for a just reward."
It may seem a "lame and impotent conclusion" that
there is no legislative panacea for our business ills, but
that upon us as individuals rests largely the responsibility
for our social improvement. Clear-sighted and impartial
observation of facts, including human nature, is our only
safe guide in social reforms; our only methods must be
the commonplace ones of preventing abuses and securing
justice in specific cases by legislation and judicial action
and by compelling men to work in the open-not some
inclusive scheme of social reorganization. We must
content ourselves with this conclusion. Its justification
is our complex human nature and the experience of the
ages.

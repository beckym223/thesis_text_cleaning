Members of the Association,

Somewhat more than twenty-five years ago some of us younger
men who were interested in the study and teaching of political
economy in the United States succeeded in organizing this Association.


The quarter of a century which has elapsed since that time has
seen a great change in the standing of the professional economist.
I think it is not too much to say that the voice of the student
of economics as such is today more potent in the United States
in the discussion and decision of public questions than it has ever
been before.

I believe that this greater position of dignity and authority
of the student and professor of economics is, in some degree,
however small, due to the work which this Association, as a body,
has accomplished; although, of course, any position of real
influence or authority which economists as a class may have won
has been due primarily to the actual merit of individual workâ€”
also perhaps in some measure to the increasing willingness of
economic students to let purely abstract or academic questions
drop into the background if thereby some positive practical
advance could be made.

The policy of President Roosevelt and President Taft of selecting
university men, and by way of preference, university men
with economic training, for some of the most important expert
positions at their disposal is a clear demonstration of the changed
attitude of the people of the United States toward the scientific
study of our political problems. And this policy which has been
adopted by the federal government has been followed to a growing
extent in our states and cities. There is a greater willingness
to give the expert a hearing-at any rate, an increasing willingness
to hear all sides of a problem before a decision is made,
which certainly augurs well for the future welfare of the nation.
It is a source of legitimate gratification to us all that so many
members of this Association have been drafted into the public

GOVERNMENT CONTROL WILL VARY UNDER INFLUENCES
OF VARIOUS KINDS.
5. The extent and method of its control of industry
will vary in different countries and under differing cir-
cumstances. There can be no general rule laid down but
this: The action of the government ought to be based on
the special circumstances of each individual case. All
comparative studies of the experiences of different coun-
tries in different lines of industry can be only suggestive.
For the settlement of any such question, however, various
factors will always be found which must be taken into
careful consideration.
POLITICAL CONDITIONS AFFECT CONTROL.
a. The political circumstances of the country, deter-
mined quite possibly by geographical considerations, will
often be a dominating factor. Germany, for example, is
so situated geographically between France and Russia
that, in order to be certain that it can maintain its inde-
pendent existence under threatening circumstances, it
must be prepared to concentrate its military power in over-
whelming force with the greatest rapidity at the shortest
notice. Under such circumstances, considering modern
methods of warfare, its railroads should be built pri-
marily to serve promptly its military needs, although, of
course, its network of lines will probably in the long run
serve this need best if it also serve well economic ends.
Likewise the management of these roads must be such
that the government without materially lessening their
efficiency, can take immediate control and direct the traffic
to military ends with little loss of energy. The govern-
ment of Germany then must so control its railways as to
keep them always in readiness for war. It must own and
manage them, even though in so doing it were to weaken

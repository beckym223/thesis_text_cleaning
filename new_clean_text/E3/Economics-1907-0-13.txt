have been economically unjustifiable. In fact, they
have been at times productive of manifold political and
social evils. The making of great fortunes, legally, but
in ways felt to be unjust, has in many instances tended
strongly to obscure the moral vision of well-meaning men,
whose weakness has led them gladly to confound legality
with social righteousness. And their acts, again, have
formed the excuse for others to break a law that was
really working injustice.

A profit thru an unjust, tho technically legal, stockwatering
scheme may well prove far more demoralizing
in business circles than an illegal rebate which saves
from ruin a grain-shipper caught at a disadvantage.
But let us not be unjust. These evil practices, these
excuses for wrong-doing, are not confined to our great
capitalists. Even the excuse of trusteeship is not confined
to the managers of the great capitalistic corporations.
It permeates our business life. The same sentiment
is felt by the heads of the great labor organizations.
Like the glow of patriotic loyalty which
leads citizens to sacrifice on the battlefield their own
interests and those of his

those of his

families and friends

for the honor of their country, the unselfish feeling of
members of trade-unions often leads them heroically to
undergo bitter privation for themselves and for their
families in order to further the welfare of their organization
or of their class in society. But they, too, often go
too far. How often in the appeals of labor leaders we
hear the metaphors of war. They are "battling for the
rights of the toiling masses!" How often we find them
ready to adopt the methods of warfare; to resort to deception,
and even at times to violence. It is hardly too
much to say that, generally speaking, the argument of the
labor leaders against violence in support of their demands.

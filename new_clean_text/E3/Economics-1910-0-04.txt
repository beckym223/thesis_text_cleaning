upon the assembling of a large number of concrete units
which have been so frequently observed and recorded
that they have lost their individual identity and become
merged into a generalization which appears as an abstract
formula instead of a familiar vitalized phenomenon.
Again this is no criticism of the method; it is true
of all scientific exposition, including natural and physical
sciences. But what are the consequences?
Other sciences have their laboratories with an army
of observers and experimenters. In nearly every instance
the abstract reasoner is himself an observer and experimenter.
He is, at any rate, sufficiently skilled in observation
and experimentation to guide and check the observations
of his assistants. It is agreed, however, that
political economy cannot use a controlled experiment as
one of its tools, and that in so far it is not to be compared
with the physical sciences. It is, moreover, agreed that
observation in the field of economic life is extremely
difficult, but no one, it is to be presumed, will admit that
because of this difficulty observation is to be abandoned.
So far as I am aware, no one has proposed this; although,
because of this obstacle, some have despaired of
there being any true science of political economy. If we
refuse to accept this discouraging alternative, we must
have observation, difficult though it may be. If this be
conceded, the subject has two practical aspects, first the
need of finding a place for its exercise in our courses of
instruction, and, second, the need of directing and improving
the vast amount of observational work in the interest
of public welfare.

The subject of economics is taught to an increasing
number of youth, and the growing interest is likely to
continue. The pedagogical responsibilities are thus becoming
more and more serious. All will agree that

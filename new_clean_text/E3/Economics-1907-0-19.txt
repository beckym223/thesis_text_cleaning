need not blame rulers, who, in earlier days, confused
diplomacy and deceit, might and right. They, too, were
merely following custom. But in these days, with the
public opinion of the great nations of the world upholding
the ideals of justice and courtesy, it is far more easily
possible for the ruler of a state to secure its safety and
prosperity, by resting upon the principles of international
law, supported and enforced by the judgment of the
civilized Christian nations. It is coming to be the fact
that it pays a ruler and a state to be just and fair, and to
tell the truth. Among nations as among business men,
in the long run, if the sentiments of individuals are right,
good morals pay. We have every reason to believe that
this tendency also will steadily develop, until not merely
the public, but also the private acts of rulers will be subject
to tests even more rigid than those applied to private
persons in their private capacities.

In this sphere also, as well as in that of business, the
ultimate forces at work are those of human intercourse,
economic, political, social, often working unconsciously,
and public opinion, whose power strengthens as it becomes
conscious. The only way in which we can hasten the
wished-for result (and we must not neglect our task) is
by educating the people-our masters-by giving to them
the right ideals. It must eventually be fully recognized,
as it is beginning to be recognized, that the
greatest service a state can render to itself as well
as to the world, consists, not in warfare, not in extension
of territory, not in hostile rivalry, not in overreaching
foreign countries in dealings with them, but in
the prosperity which comes from ever more closely linked
intercourse in times of peace; by this intercourse, while
receiving benefit from other countries, each state in return
will render service to them.

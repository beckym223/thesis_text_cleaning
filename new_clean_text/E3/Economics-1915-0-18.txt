the doctrine that the state, representing society as a whole, must
have a definite social ideal, aim, and program; and that our eco-
nomic doctrines, aims, and methods must all fall within that
program and form a part of it. This aim may be stated as the
homely one that no one has a right to acquire, or to hold, or to use
private property in a manner injurious to others, or to the per-
manent general interest of the society of which he is a part.
Theoretically, this doctrine has always been a part of the doctrine
of private property, but, unfortunately, we have assumed that
certain uses were not adverse to the public interest, because we
assumed that they could be brought under free competition, and
that having once come within these bounds they could not be
harmful. From this we concluded, therefore, that they were bene-
ficial. We are asking, therefore, today as never before, and with
great earnestness, what uses and practices are really advantageous
to the public, and whether or not, despite the old economists, when
one does that which brings financial gain to himself he does what
is best for the public.
We are even inquiring, contrary to the wisdom of our fathers,
whether the private citizen necessarily always knows his own
interest, and, most of all, if he does know it whether he is always
economically and politically situated where he can pursue that
private interest effectively.
The economists now, almost without exception, admit that our
present institutions, customs, and laws do permit on a large and
ever-increasing scale the use of individual and corporate property
in a way that is not consistent with or conducive to public welfare
and equality of opportunity.
Such reform implies a large modification of our constitutional
laws, and the democratizing of both politics and business in such
a manner as to do justice to all and to give every one an equal
chance in life and to see that every individual born into the world
has an opportunity to develop his physical, mental, social, and
spiritual powers to as high a degree as possible in view of the
existing power of man over matter, that is, of the general pro-
ductive power of the age and country in which he lives.
If economists do not take this view of the scope, methods, and
aims of economic study, they will find themselves entirely side-
tracked, and economics becomes merely an a priori or abstract
science, with no more relation to human welfare than speculation
about the planetary system has.
